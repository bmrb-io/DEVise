right, 6: move the object right
up,    8: move the object up
down,  2: move the object down
7:        zoom in
9:        zoom out

Front and back cutting plane manipulation:

D:        move the front and back cutting plane towards each other
d:        move the front and back cutting plane away from each other
f,     F: move the front and back cutting plane in direction away from viewer
b,     B: move the front and back cutting plane in direction towards viewer

Changing viewing directions

x:       view from +x to -x
X:       view from -x to +x
y:       view from +y to -y
Y:       view from -y to +y
z:       view from +z to -z
Z:       view from -z to +z

Connect two 3D Views
(1) Using Visual Link
    The views linked will keep their camera position and all cutting planes
    (front, back, left, right, top and bottom cutting planes) consistent
(2) Using Cursor
    The destination view will display a 3D retangular block which shows the
    left, right, top, bottom, front and back cutting plane of the source view.
