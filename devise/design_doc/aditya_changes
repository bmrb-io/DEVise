		Notes on Merging Aditya's Changes
			2015-07-06

(This is stuff on the aditya1_br cvs branch.)

What are the changes?:

* aditya1_br_0-aditya1_br_1:
Attempt to fix bug 1030 (error when exiting JS), plus changes to 
build_std, and moving some of the data conversion scripts around.
Merged (partially -- as much as will get merged)

I'm going to leave out the bug 1030 "fix", because it works for running
the JavaScreen on the command line, but goofs it up for the applet.

aditya_merge_br_1 tag is after this merge.


* aditya1_br_1-aditya1_br_2:
At least part of adding "reload session" button (todo 09.031).
(This is with the button labeled with "Restart" text instead of an
icon.)  Also removed "Larger" and "Smaller" from JS in embedded mode.
(Maybe merge this in conjunction with the changes that include the
icon?)

Merged.


* aditya1_br_2-aditya1_br_3:
Fixed bug 1025 (help icons don't show up in Java window).
Hmm -- this works in the non-jar version on the command line, but fails
in the applet (you don't get *anything* in the help window when you're
running from a jar file):
  java.security.AccessControlException: access denied ("java.util.PropertyPermission" "user.dir" "read")
  ...
  at java.io.File.toURI(File.java:731)
  at JavaScreen.UI.DEViseHtmlWindow.<init>(DEViseHtmlWindow.java:64)
  at JavaScreen.DEViseMainButtons$22.actionPerformed(DEViseMainButtons.java:534)
  at java.awt.MenuItem.processActionEvent(MenuItem.java:669)

I'm going to just abandon this set of changes...


* aditya1_br_3-aditya1_br_4:
Changed "Restart" button to an icon, but button is oversize.  Also added
hyperlinks to the help page in the JS window.

Merged the button change, deleted the hyperlinks change.


* aditya1_br_4-aditya1_br_5:
"Restart" button is smaller; mouse cursor mode is displayed at bottom
of JavaScreen window (todo 09.036); zoom in/out with mouse wheel (todo
09.037).

Merged.


* aditya1_br_5-aditya1_br_6:
Changed JavaScreen version and added stuff about mouse wheel zooming
to version history.

Merged.


* aditya1_br_6-aditya1_br_7:
Just updated JavaScreen help, Bugs, and Todo2 files.

Merged (edited Bugs and ToDo2 files to reflect things removed from
previous merges).


* aditya1_br_7-aditya1_br_8:
Fixes to mouse wheel zooming; click updates drill-down dialog w/o
having to dismiss it first (to-do 09.014); added mouseover to restart
button; fixed errors on JS exit (bug 1030); partially got icons and
links working in help window in JS (bug 1025); updated help page;
various other minor bug fixes.

Merged.


* aditya1_br_8-aditya1_br_9:
Fixed problem with help icons; fixed bug of drill-down marker
disappearing.  Better argument checking in corn yield conversion
script; added Unix timestamp (for better visualization) in SWAMP
data anonymizer script.

Merged.


* aditya1_br_9-aditya1_br_10:
Fixed bug in corn yield aggregator.

Merged.


* aditya1_br_10-aditya1_br_11:
Minor changes to corn yield Makefile; updated to-do list.

Merged.
