		To-do 09.039:  Replace "control views" with menus
				2015-04-17

(Also see item 1.32 in the 2013 BMRB projects list.)

We would like to be able to replace some of the "control views" in BMRB
visualizations with pull-down menus, etc.

There are several benefits from this:

1) Make the user interface more intuitive.

2) Save screen real estate.

3) Eventually add the capability to make multiple, discontinuous,
selections.


I think maybe this should be done in two phases:

1) Just add the capability to have menus that select a single item
from a list.

2) Add the capability to select multiple items.

I think that it might be possible to do phase 1 without many changes
to the DEVise server itself -- I think the actual visualization
could have a view with a cursor, and the view could have a flag that
says it should be displayed as a menu by the JavaScreen.  Then, when
the user selects something, the JavaScreen could just send a cursor
moved message to DEVise.

To do the multiple selection will be much trickier -- I don't know
how that will fit into the overall DEVise paradigm.  Maybe we could
implement something like a new filter where the records that pass the
filter are individually listed somehow.
