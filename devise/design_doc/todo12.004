		To-do 12.004:  Better way of Defining Ports
				2014-03-26

I think the "externally facing" ports are the main issue -- I don't think
the ports between the JSPoP and deviseds are that big a deal, although
if I implement a good configuration setup it might make sense to do it
for everything.

We need to define the ports on both the server side and the client
side.

I think the server side shouldn't be that hard -- "make setup" could 
edit ports+files or something like that.

The client side will be harder.  I think the ideal solution would be
if the html can include a file from the client side that specifies
which command port to use.  That file should be installed as part of
the JavaScreen installation, not by Peptide-CGI or something like that.
Will html import work for this?  (See
http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/imports/)

Hmm -- or would server-side includes work (see
http://www.boutell.com/newfaq/creating/include.html)?  Sounds like they
are a lot more widely-supported.
