062 12/6/07	OPEN	2	PDB now uses HA2/HA3 instead of HA1/HA2 for
				GLY; see if this requires Peptide-CGI (and
				ChemShift) changes. (wenger/dimitri)

063 12/14/07	OPEN	3	Incorporate error messages from ChemShift,
				molmol, and NMRPipe into s2d.out. (wenger)

				(wenger)

112 1/22/10	OPEN	3	Change tests to not create "non-standard"
				output for BMRB entries (so running the
				tests in the "real" CGI directory doesn't
				goof things up. (wenger)  (Hmm -- how will
				that work with some of the pre-release
				tests that rely on the "non-standard" output?
				Maybe allow a test name to be passed
				to make_view??

113 1/22/10	DONE	4	Change PDB ID of "none" to "internal" (or

				(Done by wenger, 2/4/10.)

115 2/2/10	OPEN	3	Be able to deal with multiple chem shift
				values for a single atom (for the same

				value for figure of merit; not sure what to
				do about actual chem shift values.) (elu/
				wenger)

116 2/2/10	NLR	5	Get SPARTA working cross-version ("main"
				entry file is 2.1 & SPARTA file is 3.x or
				vice-versa). (dmaziuk/wenger)
				(Working around this with multiple NMR-STAR
				file paths -- see #126).

117 2/2/10	DONE	2	Get SPARTA working for multiple entity
				assembly IDs (needs example). (dmaziuk/elu/
				wenger)
				(Done by wenger, 2/19/10.)

				(Done by wenger, 2/19/10.)

119 2/2/10	DONE	2	Visualization server should provide the user
				more info if processing fails (maybe echo
				the uvd.out or the error file). (elu/wenger)
				(See also 075.)

120 2/2/10	OPEN	4	Visualization server should give the user
				an option (via a button?) to reprocess with
				higher verbosity if processing fails.
				(wenger)

124 2/18/10	OPEN	2	S2DUtils.selectMatches() actually returns
				a one element array with an element of ""
				if there are no matches.  I don't think
				this is so good, because it's kind of
				ambiguous -- maybe it should either return
				null or throw an exception if there are
				no matches (but either case requires lots
				of changes to other parts of the code).
				(wenger)  (Hmm -- maybe make a new subclass
				of S2DException to throw in this case.)

125 2/23/10	DONE	1	Add -pdb_file, -lacs_file, and -sparta_file
				support to the make_uvd script.

				(Done by wenger, 3/9/10.)

				(dmaziuk/wenger)
				(Done by wenger, 3/11/10.)

127 3/15/10	OPEN	2	Add accepting X for a residue in the
				one-letter residue list, and something
				corresponding (XXX?) in the three-letter
				list. (dmaziuk/wenger)

				SPARTA visualizations are available. (wenger)

126 4/7/10	OPEN	2	Add selection by type of distance restraint

				Jmol menu images in help pages to match
				the current JS client version. (wenger)

135 4/23/10	OPEN	3	For restraints with pseudoatoms, draw
				the restraint to the pseudoatom location
				instead of drawing a line to each possible
				"real" atom. (elu/wenger)

136 5/18/10	DONE	1	Be able to easily switch to related
				visualizations within the JavaScreen.
				(elu/wenger)
				(Done by wenger, ?/?/10.)

137 6/10/10	DONE	1	Make session switching work for the
				visualization server (requires DEVise
				changes). (elu/wenger)
				(Done by wenger, 8/10/10)

138 6/29/10	OPEN	4	Treat "?" as 0.0 (in some cases, anyhow)
				(like we do now with "."). (wenger)

139 7/2/10	OPEN	2	Avoid sending error emails if torsion angle
				or distance restraint save frames are not
				found in remediated restraints file.
				(wenger)

140 7/9/10	OPEN	3	Have visualization help accessed via the
				JS rather than via a link in the html page,
				so it can be updated when you change
				sessions in the JS (probably something in
				the session file would have to specify the
				help page, with a "base" from the document
				root or something).  (This would obviously
				also take JS changes.) (wenger)

141 7/27/10	DONE	1	Add JavaScreen command port to the Peptide-
				CGI configuration, so I can easily set up
				an installation that uses the test JSPoP
				at CS. (wenger)
				(Done by wenger, 7/29/10, on
				fix_3d_cursor_br)

142 7/27/10	OPEN	1	Set up BMRB examples for the JavaScreen
				examples page that are not affected by
				"normal" Peptide-CGI processing.  (Note
				that I'll need separate schema files.)
				It should be reasonably easy to update the
				examples as Peptide-CGI changes -- maybe
				give a special name when processing.
				(wenger)

143 7/29/10	OPEN	4	Add a prefix to all generated files for
				the "test" setup, so it and the "normal"
				setup can co-exist peacefully on teal.
				(wenger)

144 8/3/10	OPEN	1	Heteronuclear NOEs in 3.1 files need to be
				split out by _Heteronucl_NOE.Atom_ID_1 and
				_Heteronucl_NOE.Atom_ID_2 values (each
				_Heteronucl_NOE.Atom_ID_1/
				_Heteronucl_NOE.Atom_ID_2 pair, order not
				significant, should be a separate
				visualization).  Note: in 2.1, different
				pairs are in separate save frames.
				(elu/wenger)  (Note: 4267 has some NOEs that
				are N/H, and some that hare NE1/HE1, but
				the 3.1 file I have has them all in separate
				save frames.  I guess I could combine them
				for testing.)

145 8/6/10	DUP	3	Change "none" to "internal" (or something
				else) for 4096 coordinates visualization.
				(wenger)

146 8/16/10	DONE	1	Be able to select distance restraints based
				on the magnitude of the violation.
				(elu/wenger)
				(Done by wenger, 11/22/10.)

147 8/17/10	OPEN	2	Check that BMRB residue numbers and PDB/
				coordinate residue numbers are matched
				property (do we have to use *author* number
				for the link?).  (wenger)

148 9/1/10	OPEN	4	Make use of the _Entity_assembly.PDB_chain_ID
				in NMR-STAR 3.1 files to make sure we
				coordinate entity assembly IDs correctly
				with coordindate data. (wenger)

149 9/1/10	DONE?	2	Provide a better interface for entries with
				multiple sets of chemical shift values (e.g.,
				different sample conditions), especially
				in the 3D visualizations. (elu/wenger)
				(At least partially done by wenger, 10/29/10)

150 10/15/10	DONE	1	Add logging of how long each invocation of
				Peptide-CGI takes, and whether it used the
				cache. (miron/wenger)
				(Done by wenger, 12/7/10)

151 11/1/10	OPEN	1	Check whether 'whitespace' should be changed					to 'separator' in schema files to prevent
				quotes issue. (wenger)

152 11/23/10	OPEN	4	Change distance restraint colors to avoid
				conflict with Jmol beta strands (see 10 Nov
				2010 email from Gabriel Cornilescu).
				(gabrielc/wenger)

153 12/10/10	OPEN	4	Add chemical shift values to the coordinate
				data so the user can see chemical shifts
				if they drill down on an atom. (wenger)

154 12/17/10	DONE	1	Add restraint color legend to distance
				restraint visualizations. (wenger/elu)
				(Done by wenger, 9/12/11)

155 1/10/11	OPEN	1	As part of the install process, touch
				tmp/s2d.log and set the permissions to
				666. (wenger)

156 2/1/11	DONE	2	Add a legend to the LACS visualizations
				noting the difference between red and
				yellow data points. (wenger)
				(Done by wenger, 9/12/11)

157 6/23/11	OPEN	3	In two-entry visualizations, add a connection
				between the dots representing the same two
				atoms in the two entries (if the entries
				correspond closely enough). (hongyang/wenger)

158 6/23/11	OPEN	3	In two-entry visualizations, add some kind
				of selection on the differences between
				the same two atoms in the different entries
				(see also #157). (hongyang/wenger)

159 8/9/11	OPEN	4	Make use of Java enums. (wenger)
