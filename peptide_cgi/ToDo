004 08/05/02	ACTIVE	1	Deal with NMR-STAR version 3.0 files.

005 08/05/02	OPEN	4	If some source files have changed, and
				others haven't, reprocess only the changed

				files.

007 08/05/02	DONE	1	Try again without PDB file if PDB file
				causes out-of-memory error.  (Can test with
				4001.)
				(Done by wenger, 08/06/02.)

008 08/05/02	DONE	4	Put a limit on the maximum number of atoms
				in a structure (at least until DEVise/JS
				can handle large structures better).  (Can
				test with 4081.)
				(Done by wenger, 08/05/02.)

				the destination view in all 3D visualizations.
				(wenger)
				(Done by wenger, 3/22/05.)

				reference calcuations. (schulte/wenger)

062 12/6/07	OPEN	2	PDB now uses HA2/HA3 instead of HA1/HA2 for
				GLY; see if this requires Peptide-CGI (and
				ChemShift) changes. (wenger/dimitri)

063 12/14/07	OPEN	3	Incorporate error messages from ChemShift,
				molmol, and NMRPipe into s2d.out. (wenger)
