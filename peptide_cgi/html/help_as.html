<h2>Chemical Shift Distributions by Amino Acid</h2>

<p>
This visualization shows the distribution of chemical shifts by
amino acid for the selected atom type, for all residues in the
entry.
</p>

<p>
The left view shows the three-letter amino acid abbreviations,
along with the number of occurrences of each amino acid in the
molecule.  The main view shows the distribution of chemical shift
values for the matching amino acid.  (Note that you can drill
down on the bars to see the corresponding data values.)
The bottom view selects which atom type is currently shown.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>info view</strong> (the view with the gray background)
shows the BMRB accession number and
generation date of the visualization; show the view help (F1 key)
to see the Peptide-CGI version and exact generation timestamp.
