<h2>Hydrogen Exchange</h2>
The top graph displays the log of the hydrogen exchange rates.

The bottom graph displays the log of the measured protection factors.
Positive gray bars indicate that the exchange was too slow to detect
over a 14 day period, while negative gray bars indicate residues for
which complete exchange occurred during the dead time of the
experiment (~30 min).

<!-- Uncertainty values are taken from the least-squares 
   fit. Exchange rates of 1.00E-09 were too slow to fit
   an accurate decay curve with data acquired over the
   course of the expt (14 days), and thus have no 
   associated uncertainty.
