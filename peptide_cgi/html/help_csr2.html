<h2>Observed vs. Predicted Chemical Shift Differences by Residues</h2>

<p>
The two main plots show the difference between the actual and
predicted chemical shift values, by residue, for the atom
types selected by the cursors on the left.  The atom type for each
main plot can be selected independently, so you can compare the
values for any two atom types.  The red horizontal line shows the
average difference for the selected atom type, for residues with
helix and sheet secondary structures.
</p>

<p>
The averages for CA and CB include values from all
residues; the averages for all of the other atoms 
include only values from residues belonging to helices or beta strands.
</p>

<p>
All GLY HA2 and HA3 assignments are excluded from the plots and
calculations.  All shifts from residues with large backbone 
B-factors (1.6 larger than the average) in the corresponding 
X-ray structure are excluded from the plots and calculations.
</p>

<p>
The N predicted shifts of SER, THR and GLY are excluded from all
calculations.
</p>

<p>
All chemical shift referencing correction calculations exclude large
outliers, i.e.
<ul>
<li>CA, CB, C shifts that differ by more than 6.0 ppm from predicted
values
<li>N shifts that differ by more than 13.0 ppm from predicted values
<li>HA shifts that differ by more than 1.0 ppm from predicted values
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The chemical shift referencing correction method uses chemical
shift values simulated by the DC program included in the
NMRPipe package (<a href="http://spin.niddk.nih.gov/NMRPipe/dynamo/">
http://spin.niddk.nih.gov/NMRPipe/dynamo/</a>).
