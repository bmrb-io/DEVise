<h2>Atomic Coordinates</h2>

<p>
This visualization shows the 3D structure of the relevant molecule,
in combination with all of the other data available for this entry.
</p>

<h3>Main Visualization Window</h3>

<p>
The visualization is laid out as shown below; the view names are
referred to in the text.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
The <strong>structure (main) view</strong> shows the 3D structure
(rendered by <a href="http://jmol.sourceforge.net/">Jmol</a>).
Note that you can control many options in the structure view with the
popup menus in that view and the Jmol menu in the JavaScreen menu bar.
</p>

<p>
The residues and atoms selected in the <a href="#atom_select_tree">
atom select tree</a> (see below) are highlighted in green.  You have
the option
of highlighting the atoms with a "selection halo" or by coloring the
atoms themselves (Jmol->View->Highlight in the menu bar).
Atoms not colored for highlighting are colored as follows:

<p>
The <strong>atom color legend</strong> shows the colors for
the elements.
</p>

<a name="data_view"></a>
<p>
The <strong>data view</strong> shows one of the data sets available
for this entry (selected by the <a href="#data_select_view">
data select view</a>).  The DEVise cursor in this view selects
residues according
to the data values -- residues for which the red tip of the bar is
enclosed in the cursor are selected.  By default, residues selected
in this view are selected in the <a href="#atom_select_tree">
atom select tree</a> (see below).
</p>

<p>
The <strong>data scroll view</strong> scrolls the X axis of the data
view.  The DEVise cursor selects the range of residues shown in the data view
-- you can drag the entire cursor, or drag the left or right edge to
change its size.
</p>

<a name="ea_select_view"></a>
<p>
The <strong>entity assembly select view</strong> selects the entity
assembly for which data is shown in the <strong>data select view</strong>.
If the entry being visualized has only one entity assembly, this view has
no effect.
</p>

<a name="data_select_view"></a>
<p>
The <strong>data select view</strong> selects the data set shown
in the data view.  All available data sets for the currently-selected
entity assembly are
listed in this view; by dragging the DEVise cursor you select which data set
is shown in the data view.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>data select scroll view</strong> scrolls the data select view
if the data select view has more than ten data sets available for
visualization.  Note that the DEVise cursor in this view is fixed-size.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>info view</strong> shows the BMRB accession number (and
PDB ID, if relevant) and generation date of the visualization; show
the view help (F1 key) to see the Peptide-CGI version and exact
generation timestamp.
</p>

<h5>Sample info drill-down</h5>

<p>
As shown in the image below, you can access information about the save
frame details, sample, and sample conditions by drilling down on a
text item in the data select view.  (You need to be fairly close to the
center of the text object for the drill down to work -- try it at a
slightly different position if it initially doesn't work.)

<h3>Structure Selection Window</h3>

<p>
Selection of which atoms to display and highlight is now done in a
separate window, to allow more space in the main window to be used for
the structure view and data view.
</p>

<p>
<center>
<img src="coordinate_vis_select.png">

</p>

<p>
The <strong>structure type tree</strong> selects which atoms are shown
in the structure view by structure type (backbone, backbone and side chains,
or backbone, side chains, and hydrogens).  Changing what's selected in
this tree also changes what is displayed in the atom display tree and
the atom select tree.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>atom display tree</strong> selects which atoms are displayed
in the structure view.  The atom display tree allows selection of the entire
molecule, or parts of the molecule by residue and individual atom.
Changing what's selected in this tree also changes what is displayed
in the atom select tree.
</p>

<a name="atom_select_tree"></a>
<p>
The <strong>atom select tree</strong> selects which atoms are highlighted
in the structure view.  The atom select tree allows selection of the entire
molecule, or parts of the molecule by residue and individual atom.
By default, the residues selected in the <a href="#data_view">
data view</a> are also selected in the atom select tree.  You can change
which residues and atoms are selected by manipulating the tree.  The
Reset button sets the selection in the tree back to the residues selected
in the
data view.
