<h2>Atomic Coordinates</h2>

<p>
This visualization shows the 3D structure of the relevant molecule,
in combination with all of the other data available for this entry.
</p>

<p>
The visualization is laid out as shown below; the view names are
referred to in the text.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>structure (main) view</strong> shows the 3D structure.
The sections of the structure belonging to residues selected in the
data view are highlighted in green.  All other atoms are colored as
follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Carbon: gray
<li>Oxygen: red
<li>Nitrogen: blue
<li>Sulfur: orange
<li>Phosphorus: pink
<li>Hydrogen: white
</ul>

<p>
The <strong>data view</strong> shows one of the data sets available
for this entry.  The cursor in this view selects residues according
to the data values -- residues for which the red tip of the bar are
enclosed in the cursor are selected.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>data scroll view</strong> scrolls the X axis of the data
view.  The cursor selects the range of residues shown in the data view
-- you can drag the entire cursor, or drag the left or right edge to
change its size.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>data select view</strong> selects which data set is shown
in the data view.  All available data sets for the current entry are
shown in this view; by dragging the cursor you select which data set
is shown.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>atom select view</strong> selects which atoms are shown
the structure view (backbone, backbone and side chains, or backbone,
side chains, and hydrogens).
</p>

<p>
The <strong>residue list view</strong> lists the residue number
and amino acid for each residue.  Residues selected in the data
view are highlighted in green in this view.  The cursor (which
is linked to the cursor in the residue select view) selects which
residues are shown in the structure view.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>residue list scroll view</strong> scrolls the residue
list view.  The cursor can be dragged to select the range of residues
shown (note that this cursor is fixed-size).
</p>

<p>
The <strong>residue select view</strong> selects which residues are
shown in the structure view -- all residues within the cursor are
shown.  This cursor is a variable-size cursor.
