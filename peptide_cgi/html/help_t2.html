<h2>T2 Relaxation</h2>

<p>
The <em>transverse relaxation time</em> or <em>spin-spin relaxation
time</em> (<em>T</em><sub>2</sub>) describes the decay rate of the
effective magnetization observed in the <em>x,y</em> plane after a
90&#176 pulse.  <em>T</em><sub>2</sub> is shorter than or equal to
<em>T</em><sub>1</sub>.  Differences between <em>T</em><sub>1</sub>
and <em>T</em><sub>2</sub> arise because of loss of <em>phase
coherence</em> among the individual spins that precess in the
<em>x,y</em> plane and constitute the macroscopic, observable
magnetization.  <em>T</em><sub>2</sub> is correlated with dynamic
processes in the molecule under study; in particular it decreases
monotonously with increasing molecular size, which presents a
limiting factor for high resolution NMR with macromolecules.
