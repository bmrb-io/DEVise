<h2>Order Parameters</h2>

    S2 value: The generalized order parameters (S2) are calculated from 15N
    relaxation data
    <br><br>
    
    Tau e value: Internal motional time constants for models evaluated 
    with S2 and Tau_e as fitted parameters in the final model-free
    analysis.
    <br><br>

    Rex value: Chemical exchange terms for residues which were fit
    with S2 and R_ex as fiited parameters in the final model-free
    analysis.
    <br><br>

    Sum-squared errors: these come from the final calculation of
    model-free parameters.
