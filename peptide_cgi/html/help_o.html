<h2>Order Parameters</h2>

<p>
S2 value: The generalized order parameters (S2) are calculated from 15N
relaxation data
</p>
    
<p>
Tau e value: Internal motional time constants for models evaluated 
with S2 and Tau_e as fitted parameters in the final model-free
analysis.
</p>

<p>
Rex value: Chemical exchange terms for residues which were fit
with S2 and R_ex as fitted parameters in the final model-free
analysis.
</p>

<p>
Sum-squared errors: these come from the final calculation of
model-free parameters.
