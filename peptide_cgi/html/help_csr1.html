<h2>Observed vs. Predicted Chemical Shift Difference Histograms</h2>

<p>
The main plot shows a histogram of the differences between the
actual and predicted chemical shift values, for the type of atom
selected by the cursor in the bottom plot.  For CA and CB,
values from all residues are shown; for other atoms, only
values from residues with helix and sheet secondary structures
are shown.
</p>

<p>
The average and tolerance for CA and CB include values from all
residues; the average and tolerance for all of the other atoms
include only values from residues belonging to helices or beta strands.
</p>

<p>
All GLY HA2 and HA3 assignments are excluded from the plots and
calculations.  All shifts from residues with large backbone 
B-factors (1.6 larger than the average) in the corresponding 
X-ray structure are excluded from the plots and calculations.
</p>

<p>
The N predicted shifts of SER, THR and GLY are excluded from all
calculations.
</p>

<p>
All chemical shift referencing correction calculations exclude large
outliers, i.e.
<ul>
<li>CA, CB, C shifts that differ by more than 6.0 ppm from predicted
values
<li>N shifts that differ by more than 13.0 ppm from predicted values
<li>HA shifts that differ by more than 1.0 ppm from predicted values
</ul>
</p>

<p>
For all atoms a chemical shift referencing correction is
needed (advised) if the average deviation is larger than

<pre>
    3*rmsd(atom)/sqrt(N(atom))
</pre>

i.e., only if the average deviation exceeds by more than a factor
of three the expected random variation in this average. The width
of the brown area represents this maximum expected average deviation
and the suggested correction corresponds ONLY to cases when
the origin of the chemical shift difference axis lies outside
the brown area.  Only in these cases is there a need for a
referencing correction in the amount (in ppm) indicated by the
position of the thick orange line (the average deviation).
</p>

<p>
The chemical shift referencing correction method uses chemical
shift values simulated by the DC program included in the
NMRPipe package (<a href="http://spin.niddk.nih.gov/NMRPipe/dynamo/">
http://spin.niddk.nih.gov/NMRPipe/dynamo/</a>).
