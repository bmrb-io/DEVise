<h2>SPARTA-Calculated Chemical Shift Delta</h2>

<p>
This visualization shows predicted chemical shift deltas calculated
by <a href="http://spin.niddk.nih.gov/bax/software/SPARTA/index.html">
SPARTA</a>.
</p>

<p>
SPARTA is a database system for empirical prediction of backbone
chemical shifts (N, HN, HA, CA, CB, CO) using a combination of
backbone phi, psi torsion angles and sidechain chi1 angles from a
given protein with known PDB coordinates. The SPARTA approach is
an extension of the well-known observation that many kinds of
secondary chemical shifts (i.e. differences between chemical shifts
and their corresponding random coil values) are highly correlated
with aspects of protein secondary structure. The goal of SPARTA is
to use phi, psi, chi1 torsion angles and sequence information from
proteins structure in order to make quantitative predictions for
the backbone chemical shifts.

<p>
This visualization shows predicted chemical shift deltas for
H, HA, C, CA, CB, and N.  The leftmost view controls the model for
which the delta shifts are shown.  (Note that, when showing the
values for the average of all models, drilling down on the data
will show a model number of 0.)
