<h2>Java Web Start</h2>

<p>
At the end of 2016 major browser vendors disabled NPAPI support which was required
to launch the DEVise visualizations directly from the browser. The DEVise visualization
tool is still available but it now requires a few extra steps for you access the visualizations.
</p>

<h3>macOS Sierra</h3>

<p>
Regardless of which browser you use, you will need to navigate to the location of the
downloaded file in the finder and then open it from there. New macOS security rules
prevent you from launching the file directly after download.
</p>

<p>Here is an example of how to launch DEVise from Safari:</p>

<ol>
<li>Navigate to the visualization you wish to view, and click the "Click here to launch DEVise for this visualization" text:
<br><img src="jnlp_mac1.png" height="60%" width="60%"></li>

<li> A file ending in .jnlp will download. You cannot click on it directly from the downloads list - macOS will not allow you to open it that way.
<br><img src="jnlp_mac2.png" height="60%" width="60%"></li>

<li> Open up the Finder and navigate to the location of the file you downloaded.
<br><img src="jnlp_mac3.png" height="60%" width="60%"></li>

<li> Either right click or control-click on the .jnlp file and select "Open With" -> "Java Web Start":
<br><br><img src="jnlp_mac4.png" height="60%" width="60%"></li>

<li> Click "Open" on the dialog box that appears.
<br><img src="jnlp_mac5.png" height="60%" width="60%"></li>
</ol>

<p>If you are still unable to launch the application after following these
steps, go to System settings -> Java -> Security and change the setting from
"Very High" to "High".</p>
