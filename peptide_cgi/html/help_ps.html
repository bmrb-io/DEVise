<h2>Assignment Figure of Merit Visualization</h2>

<p>
This visualization shows a schematic structure of the relevant molecule,
in combination with the assignment figure of merit values available for
this entry.
</p>

<p>
The visualization is laid out as shown below; the view names are
referred to in the text.

<p>
The <strong>structure (main) view</strong> shows a schematic structure.
The sections of the structure belonging to residues selected in the
data view are highlighted in green.  All other atoms are colored by
either figure of merit value or atom type, as follows:

<p>
The default is to have the atoms colored by figure of merit value, but
this can be changed to coloring by atom type by dragging the cursor
in the <strong>color select view</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>figure of merit legend view</strong> shows the colors for the
various figure of merit values (or the colors for the elements, if coloring
by atom type is selected).
</p>

<p>
The <strong>data view</strong> shows the fraction of atoms of the
selected type (backbone, side chain, H) in each residue having
figure of merit values within the selected range, relative to the
total number of the selected type of atoms in the appropriate amino
acid.
</p>

<!-- give a specific example here once I find out about the backbone/
side chain issues -- see email of June 30, 2005 -->

<!-- put a note in here about which things are treated as backbone
once I figure that out properly -->

<p>
Note that, for a given residue, the fraction of atoms with a figure of
merit >= 95% and the fraction with a figure of merit < 95% may not add
up to 1.0, since the denominator of the fraction is the number of
atoms expected in the given amino acid, not the number for which we
have figure of merit values.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>data scroll view</strong> scrolls the X axis of the data
view.  The cursor selects the range of residues shown in the data view
-- you can drag the entire cursor, or drag the left or right edge to
change its size.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>data select view</strong> selects which data set is shown
in the data view; in this case, the data sets are the the different
combinations of structure (backbone, side chain, or hydrogen) and
figure of merit >= 95% or < 95%.
All available data sets for the current entry are
shown in this view; by dragging the cursor you select which data set
is shown.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>atom select view</strong> selects which atoms are shown
the structure view (backbone, backbone and side chains, or backbone,
side chains, and hydrogens).  The default is backbone and side chains.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>residue list view</strong> lists the residue number
and amino acid for each residue.  Residues selected in the data
view are highlighted in green in this view.  The cursor (which
is linked to the cursor in the residue select view) selects which
residues are shown in the structure view.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>residue list scroll view</strong> scrolls the residue
list view.  The cursor can be dragged to select the range of residues
shown (note that this cursor is fixed-size).
</p>

<p>
The <strong>residue select view</strong> selects which residues are
shown in the structure view -- all residues within the cursor are
shown.  This cursor is a variable-size cursor.  The default is to
show all residues.
