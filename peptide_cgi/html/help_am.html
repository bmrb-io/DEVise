<h2>Ambiguity Values</h2>

<p>
This visualization shows a schematic structure of the relevant molecule,
in combination with the ambiguity values available for this entry.
</p>

<p>
The visualization is laid out as shown below; the view names are
referred to in the text.

<p>
The <strong>structure (main) view</strong> shows a schematic structure.
The sections of the structure belonging to residues selected in the
data view are highlighted in green.  All other atoms are colored by
either ambiguity code value or atom type, as follows:

<p>
The default is to have the atoms colored by ambiguity code value, but
this can be changed to coloring by atom type by dragging the cursor
in the <strong>color select view</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Note that H, HA, HA2, and HA3 atoms are treated as part of the backbone
in this visualization.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>ambiguity code legend</strong> shows the colors for the
various ambiguity codes (or the colors for the elements, if coloring
by atom type is selected).
</p>

<p>
The <strong>data view</strong> shows the fraction of atoms in each
residue having the selected ambiguity code, relative to the total
number of C, H, and N atoms in the appropriate amino acid.  For
example, if five atoms have the selected ambiguity code in a 
residue that is a histidine, the value displayed in the graph for that
residue will be 0.294.
The cursor in this view selects residues according
to the data values -- residues for which the red tip of the bar are
enclosed in the cursor are selected.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>data scroll view</strong> scrolls the X axis of the data
view.  The cursor selects the range of residues shown in the data view
-- you can drag the entire cursor, or drag the left or right edge to
change its size.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>data select view</strong> selects which data set is shown
in the data view; in this case, the data sets are the the different
ambiguity codes.
All available data sets for the current entry are
shown in this view; by dragging the cursor you select which data set
is shown.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>atom select view</strong> selects which atoms are shown
the structure view (backbone, backbone and side chains, or backbone,
side chains, and hydrogens).  The default is backbone and side chains.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>residue list view</strong> lists the residue number
and amino acid for each residue.  Residues selected in the data
view are highlighted in green in this view.  The cursor (which
is linked to the cursor in the residue select view) selects which
residues are shown in the structure view.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>residue list scroll view</strong> scrolls the residue
list view.  The cursor can be dragged to select the range of residues
shown (note that this cursor is fixed-size).
</p>

<p>
The <strong>residue select view</strong> selects which residues are
shown in the structure view -- all residues within the cursor are
shown.  This cursor is a variable-size cursor.  The default is to
show all residues.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>info view</strong> shows the BMRB accession number and
generation date of the visualization; show the view help (F1 key)
to see the Peptide-CGI version and exact generation timestamp.
