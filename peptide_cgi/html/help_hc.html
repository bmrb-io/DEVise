<h2>Simulated 1H-13C HSQC Spectrum</h2>

<p>
The visualization is laid out as shown below; the view names are
referred to in the text.

<p>
The <strong> main view</strong> in this visualization shows a small circle for each
bonded carbon/hydrogen pair for which chemical shifts are available
for both atoms.  Each circle is located by the C chemical shift on the Y
axis and the H chemical shift on the X axis.  For the amino 
acid(s) selected in the amino acid view, all of the appropriate circles
are filled in with a red dot.  For the residues selected in the residue
list view, the "normal" circles are surrounded by a yellow circle.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>amino acid</strong> view shows the three-letter amino acid abbreviations,
along with the number of occurrences of each amino acid in the
molecule.  The cursor selects the amino acid(s) to highlight in
the main view, residue list view, and residue scroll view.
(Note that the cursor can be enlarged to select
more than one amino acid; it can also be moved to the blank region
at the top to select no amino acids.)
</p>

<p>
The <strong>residue list view</strong> shows a list of single-letter
amino acid abbreviations for the residue sequence.  The residues
selected (within the yellow cursor) are highlighted in yellow in
the main view.  "Normal" residues are shown in violet; residues for
which there is no 1H-13C data available are shown in pink; and
residues of the amino acid selected in the amino acid view are
show in red.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>residue scroll view</strong> selects the range of residues
shown in the residue list view (this is done because showing all
residues would often make the letters unreadable).  The colors are
the same as in the residue list view.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>info view</strong>
shows the BMRB accession number and
generation date of the visualization; display the view help (F1 key)
to see the Peptide-CGI version and exact generation timestamp.
