<h2>Simulated 1H-13C HSQC Spectrum</h2>

<p>
The main view in this visualization shows a small circle for each
bonded carbon/hydrogen pair for which chemical shifts are available
for both atoms.  Each circle is located by the C chemical shift on the Y
axis and the H chemical shift on the X axis.  For the selected amino
acid(s), all of the appropriate circles are filled in with a red dot.
</p>

<p>
The left view shows the three-letter amino acid abbreviations,
along with the number of occurrences of each amino acid in the
molecule.  The cursor selects the amino acid(s) to highlight in
the main view.  (Note that the cursor can be enlarged to select
more than one amino acid.)
</p>

<p>
The <strong>info view</strong> (the view with the gray background)
shows the BMRB accession number and
generation date of the visualization; show the view help (F1 key)
to see the Peptide-CGI version and exact generation timestamp.
