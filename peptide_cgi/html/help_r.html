<h2>Relaxation Paraemters</h2>

These are backbone 15N relaxation parameters for individual residues.
The top graph is 1/T1 at 750 MHz, the second is 1/T2 at 750 MHz, the
third is 1/T2 at 600 MHz, and the bottom shows 1H-15N NOE values at 750
MHz.  Gaps correspond to prolines or to residues whose values could
not be measured because of spectral overlap.
