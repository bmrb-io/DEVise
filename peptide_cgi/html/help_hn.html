<p>
The main view in this visualization shows a small circle for each
residue, located by the N chemical shift on the Y axis and the H
chemical shift on the X axis.  For the selected amino acid(s), all of
the appropriate circles are filled in with a red dot.
</p>

<p>
The left view shows the three-letter amino acid abbreviations,
along with the number of occurrences of each amino acid in the
molecule.  The cursor selects the amino acid(s) to highlight in
the main view.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>info view</strong> (the view with the gray background)
shows the BMRB accession number and
generation date of the visualization; show the view help (F1 key)
