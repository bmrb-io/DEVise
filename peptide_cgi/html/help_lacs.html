<h2>LACS Data</h2>

<p>
1. The Y-axis represents the secondary chemical shifts of the nuclei:
CA for alpha carbon, CB for beta carbon, HA for alpha proton and CO
for carbonyl carbon. Secondary chemical shifts are calculated by
subtracting random coil chemical shifts[1] from experimental observed
values.
</p>

<p>
2. The X-axis represents the secondary chemical shift difference
between CA and CB.
</p>

<p>
3. LACS shows the secondary chemical shift relationship between
CA (or CB, HA, CO) and CA-CB for a single protein.
</p>

<p>
4. Points with a positive CA-CB value are fitted to get one line
corresponding to the transition from random coil to alpha helix;
points with a negative CA-CB value are fitted to get another line
corresponding to the transition from random coil to beta sheet.
</p>

<p>
5. The vertical line is located at the position of CA-CB = 0. Considering 
the referencing independence of CA-CB, this is the position where an amino 
acid in random coil state will fall with the highest probability (in 
the X-dimension).
</p>

<p>
6. The intersection between the vertical line and the fitted line gives us 
the position where an amino acid in random coil state will fall with the 
highest probability in Y-dimension.
</p>

<p>
7. The existing of two intersection points (with two fitted lines) is due to 
the limitation of experimental data as well as using a rough linear model. To 
compensate for these limitations, the random coil highest probability 
position in the Y-dimension is estimated as the average of the Y-axis of these 
two intersection points. At this average position, a horizontal line is 
drawn.
</p>

<p>
8. An individual nucleus (CA, CB, HA, CO) has the highest probability of being 
in the random coil state when its secondary chemical shift is zero. Thus the 
horizontal line represents the possible referencing adjustment needed for 
the investigated protein.
