<h2>Observed vs. Predicted Chemical Shift Values</h2>

<p>
The main plot graphs all selected chemical shift values by the
observed value (Y axis) versus the predicted value (X axis).
The cursor on the left selects which atom type is displayed,
and the cursor on the bottom selects the secondary structures
for which data is displayed; the secondary structure is also
indicated by the color code.  The diagonal white line is the
line x=y, for reference.
</p>

<p>
All GLY HA2 and HA3 assignments are excluded from the plots and
calculations.  All shifts from residues with large backbone
B-factors (1.6 larger than the average) in the corresponding
X-ray structure are excluded from the plots and calculations.
</p>

<p>
The N predicted shifts of SER, THR and GLY are excluded from all
calculations.
</p>

<p>
All chemical shift referencing correction calculations exclude large
outliers, i.e.
<ul>
<li>CA, CB, C shifts that differ by more than 6.0 ppm from predicted
values
<li>N shifts that differ by more than 13.0 ppm from predicted values
<li>HA shifts that differ by more than 1.0 ppm from predicted values
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The chemical shift referencing correction method uses chemical
shift values simulated by the DC program included in the
NMRPipe package (<a href="http://spin.niddk.nih.gov/NMRPipe/dynamo/">
http://spin.niddk.nih.gov/NMRPipe/dynamo/</a>).
