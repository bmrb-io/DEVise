      <H4>Easier Visualization Switching in DEVise</H4>

      <p>We have released a new version of the DEVise visualization tool that
	allows users to switch visualizations within the DEVise applet.  (Note
	that, as part of this change, visualizations now appear in a new window,
	rather than embedded within the browser window.)
      </p>
      <p>To switch between available visualizations for a given entry, select
	Session->Open/Switch in the DEVise applet. This will show a dialog
	listing the visualizations that are currently available for the current
	entry.  Note that some visualizations (such as coordinates and restraints)
	require additional processing on the server, so you may have to go back
	to the "all visualizations" page for the entry to access them.  Also,
	if you switch visualizations inside the JavaScreen, the "help on this
	visualization" link will no longer correspond to the visualization you
	are viewing.
      </p>
      <p>This functionality is currently not available within the visualization
	server where users can upload data from their local computer and obtain 
	a visualization of the data.</p>
