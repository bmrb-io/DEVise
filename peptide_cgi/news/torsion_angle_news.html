      <H4>Torsion angle restraint visualizations</H4>
      <P>We have added visualizations of torsion angle restraints, and their
		 violations, to the available visualizations for BMRB entries.  The
		 visualizations consist of torsion angle restraint data (from the
		 restraints grid, with violations calculated by CING), combined with
		 coordinates from the PDB entry, producing integrated visualizations of
		 the torsion angle restraint data and the 3D molecule. The torsion angle
		 data can also be visualized based on PDB ID, rather than BMRB accession
		 number (see the <a href="/search/">search page</a>).  For more detailed information, see the
		 <a href="/devise/peptide-cgi/html/help_tar.html">visualization help page</a>.
