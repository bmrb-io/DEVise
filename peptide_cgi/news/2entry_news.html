      <H4>Two-Entry Visualizations</H4>

      <p>We have released a new version of the Peptide-CGI visualization
        generation tool that allows the creation of visualizations
	incorporating data from two entries (or data uploaded to the
	visualization server and a released entry).  At the present time,
	the two-entry visualizations available are the simulated 1H-15N
	backbone HSQC spectrum and the simulated 1H-13C HSQC spectrum
	(more visualizations are planned).  It is not yet possible to
	generate visualizations combining two visualization server
	data sets.
      </p>

      <p>You can access the two-entry visualizations in two ways:
        <ul>
	<li>On the visualization summary page for each entry (or
	  visualization server data set), there is a form that allows
	  you to enter an accession number, which is then visualized in
	  combination with the current entry.
	<li>There is also a two-entry
	  <a href="../../devise/peptide-cgi/bmrb_select2.html">
          selection page</a>.
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>Note that, to compare uploaded data with a released entry, you
        must first upload your data to the <a href="../../vis_serv/">
	visualization server</a> and generate the single-data set
	visualizations.  At that point, you can specify an entry to
	compare with your data.
      </p>

      <p>For an example using entries 16606 and 16607, click
        <a href="../../cgi-bin/peptide-cgi/make_view?number=16606&xbmrbid=16607">
        here</a>.
      </p>
