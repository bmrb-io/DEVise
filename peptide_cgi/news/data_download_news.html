      <H4>Data Download in Visualizations</H4>

      <p>We have released a new version of the DEVise visualization tool
        that allows users to download data from a given view within a
	visualization.
      </p>
      <p>To download data from a view, select data download mode
        in the toolbar (the <img src="data_download.default.png"> icon).
	Then click in the view for which you want to download the data.
	Your browser should create a new tab or window with a
	comma-separated value file containing the data, which you can
	then save to your computer.  (If your browser does not create
	such a tab or window, you can manually copy and paste the URL
	from the DEVise dialog into a browser tab or window.)
      </p>
      <p>Note that some visualizations have multiple views overlaid on
        each other, with a transparent background for all but the back
	view.  In this case, if you download data, you will get data
	for each view that is overlaid (all in a single file, but with
	each data set separated by header information).
      </p>
      <p>Currently, only data falling within the axis ranges of the
        view as it's currently displayed is downloaded.  Therefore, if
	you want to be sure to get all data associated with the view,
	do home (<img src="home_filter.default.png"> in the toolbar) on
	the view before doing your data download.
      </p>
      <p>This feature works with all visualizations (single-entry,
        two-entry, histograms, and the visualization server).  The main
	limitation is that it currently does not work in three-dimensional
	views.  (It does, however, work in the two-dimensional view of
	visualizations containing three-dimensional views.)
      </p>
