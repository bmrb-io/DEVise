      <H4>Visualizations of distance restraints and their violations </H4>

      <p>We have added visualizations of distance restraints to the available
	visualizations for BMRB entries.  The visualizations consist of distance
	restraint data (from the restraints grid, with violations calculated by
	CING, or from the remediated restraints), combined with coordinates
	from the PDB entry, producing integrated visualizations of the distance
	restraint data and the 3D structure.  The distance restraint data can
	also be visualized based on PDB ID, rather than BMRB accession number
	(see the BMRB search page at http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/search/).</p> 

	<p>For more detailed information, see the visualization help page 
	<a href="http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/devise/peptide-cgi/html/help_distr.html">here</a>.
