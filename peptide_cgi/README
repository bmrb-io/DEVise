			Notes on Rich's Peptide CGI Code
			$Id$

FILES

* AssgDataManager.java: reads assignment file, generates numbers for
percentage assignments of residues.

* GetBackbone.java: has main() function to enable other stuff to be
run.  May not need to be used.

* LineTokens.java: used for delta shift info -- reads a chem shift file.

* LocalStar2Devise.java: converts a local star file to a DEVise table.

* ShiftDataManager.java: manages chem shift info.

* Summarize.java: test code.

* WebStar2Devise.java: converts a star file to a DEVise table, accessing
the star file via a URL.  Note: most of the code here is the same as
LocalStar2Devise.java, but LocalStar2Devise.java may be more up-to-date.

* add_vars.pl: takes a file with variable values and a file with bonds,
and outputs a file with bonds and variable values.  (All files are
DEVise table files.)

* build_bonds.pl: takes an amino acid connection file and a file listing
the atoms of a peptide and their locations in 3-space, and outputs a
file explicitly listing all bonds and their locations in 3-space.
Note that there are actually two records in the output table for
each bond, so that each half-bond can be colored according to the
type of atom involved.

* data_key.txt: a list of fields in some of the DEVise table files.

* cgi-bin/combine: combines separate files generated from a star file
into a single output file.  (Right now Rich's code generates separate
intermediate files for the various parts of the star file.)  This code
has special provision for cases where some of the intermediate files
have missing lines.

* cgi-bin/make_view: top-level CGI script -- calls WebStar2Devise,
modifies session file (changes name of data stream), generates html
code.

* dynamic_sessions/*.base: session templates to be modified by
make_view.

* html/assignments.txt: chemical info used by scripts.

* html/chemshift.txt: chemical info used by scripts.

* html/data_defs.txt: explanation of file name conventions.

* html/help_*.html: reference information from Eldon.

* html/helpmaster.js: JavaScript to pop up a temporary window when the
mouse is move over appropriate areas.

* html/label.dat: dummy data for views that are created only to show an
axis.


TESTING/RUNNING
TEMPTEMP
- Put CGI in place???
- Change make_view according to directory.


INSTALLATION
on biron:

* /var/home/www/cgi-bin/bmrb

* /p/devise/demo/dat/bmrb/BMRB (link to /local.biron/pdc/BMRB): contains
html files and session files.

* /u/p/d/pdc/public/pub_research/: Java class files.  NO!! where the
hell are the class files?
