			Testing the Visualization Server
	$Id$

* OVERVIEW

This document details "routine" (manual) testing that should be done
to make sure the visualization server is working properly at BMRB and
the mirror sites.  This testing should be done at least once a week.


* URLS

(Note that the visualization server can be accessed through the
"Spectroscopists' Corner" link on the web site.)

* TESTING THE VISUALIZATION SERVER

For each of the visualization server URLs listed above, perform the
following procedure:

* Click the "create session" button.

* Enter your email in the "E-mail session ID to" box.

* Click the "Browse" button and upload a copy of bmr4267.str (entry 4267)
that you've previously saved.

* Click the "Upload" button.

* Make sure you get the email with the session ID.

* Make sure the visualization summary page has all of the following
visualizations:
    * 3D structure: 1NGL, 1DFV
    * Chemical shift data for entity assembly 1:
        * Chemical shift delta
        * Chemical shift index
        * Percent assigned atoms
        * Chem shift distributions by AA/nucleotide
        * Simulated 1H-15N backbone HSQC spectrum
        * Simulated 1H-13C HSQC spectrum
        * Assigned chemical shift ambiguity code data
    * Chemical Shift Referencing Visualizations; three each for 1NGL and
    1DFV (note that these visualizations will not be generated at the
    Florence mirror):
        * Difference histograms
        * Differences by residue
        * Observed vs. calculated chemical shift values
    * Linear Analysis of Chemical Shifts (note that these visualizations
    will not be generated at the Osaka and Florence mirrors):
        * CA vs. CA-CB
        * CB vs. CA-CB
        * HA vs. CA-CB
        * CO vs. CA-CB
    * Coupling constants
    * T1/T2 relaxation:
        * T1, 500 MHz
        * T1, 600 MHz
        * T1, 750 MHz
        * T2, 500 MHz
        * T2, 600 MHz
        * T2, 750 MHz
    * Heteronuclear NOE:
        * 750 MHz NE1 HE1 (2 values) (1)
        * 750 MHz NE HE (2 values) (1)
        * 750 MHz N H (146 values) (1)
        * 600 MHz NE1 HE1 (2 values) (1)
        * 600 MHz NE HE (3 values) (1)
        * 600 MHz N H (146 values) (1)
        * 600 MHz NE1 HE1 (2 values) (1)
        * 600 MHz NE HE (2 values) (1)
        * 500 MHz N H (138 values) (1)
    * S2 Order Parameters

* Follow at least the following links, and perform the listed tests:
    * 3D structure for 1NGL:
	* Select "HA delta chem shift [1]" as the data set.
	* Expand the data view to show all residues.
	* Expand the cursor in the data view to fill the view, and verify
	that all atoms are highlighted in the 3D view.
	* Select just the first residue in the "Atom Selection" tree.
	* Drill down on the sulfur atom in that residue, and make sure that
	the Residue_seq_code is 1, Residue_label is MET, Atom_name is SD,
	and Atom_type is S.
	* Click the "Reset" button under the "Atom Selection" tree, and
	verify that all atoms are again highlighted.
    * Chem shift distributions by AA/nucleotide:
	* Select each of the three atom types, and verify that bars show
	up for all three.
	* Test drilling down on one of the bars.
    * Observed vs. calculated chemical shift values for 1DFV:
	* Verify that you see values for helix, sheet, and other (magenta,
	blue, and yellow).
	* Select a different atom.
	* Reduce the secondary structure selection and make sure that data
	points are removed accordingly.
    * Linear Analysis of Chemical Shifts, CO vs. CA-CB:
    	* Zoom in on one of the red ovals.
	* Drill down on it, and make sure that "Designator" is 0.

* Make sure the session ID works for restarting by closing the browser
tab with the visualization summary page, going back to the visualization
server starting page, and entering the session ID.
