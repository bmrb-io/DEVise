To-do 191:  Simulated spectrum vis improvements.

Highlighting better than selection for this?  But maybe selection for
multi-entry vis

Eldon wants different-colored letters for residues that don't have HN
data -- maybe make a list of all residues and put that in the background
view of a pile with the existing sequence data view.

Need to avoid "squashing" of letters in sequence view -- try offsetting
diagonally?

Maybe add a cursor in the main view that highlights residues in the
residue view?

Hmm -- what about entries with multiple entity assemblies?  Maybe make
a separate residue list for each entity assembly?  Ah, maybe graph
the rl.dat list with entity assembly ID as the Y axis, and also graph
the hn1.dat list with entity assembly ID as the Y axis, and do home
(at least in the Y direction) only on the hn1.dat view.
(Need to find an appropriate entry with two entity assemblies to test
this.)

I probably shouldn't *exclude* the view with all residues from the home,
in case the first or last residue doesn't have H/N or H/C data -- but
probably make home X-only for that, so it doesn't show the "wrong"
entity assembly.

Maybe the easiest thing to do would be to create separate residue lists
for each entity assembly (or each chem shift table).

141021:  Feedback from John M at BMRB staff meeting:
- Color residues differently in residue list views:
    - Red or pink for no H/N data assigned
    - White for PRO (no H/N)?
- Color amyds/side chains differently?  (Need to find out more about
  what this means.)  Also maybe have a way to toggle them on and off.
- Be sure to fix up view help.
