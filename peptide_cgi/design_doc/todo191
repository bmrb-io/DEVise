To-do 191:  Simulated spectrum vis improvements.

Highlighting better than selection for this?  But maybe selection for
multi-entry vis

Eldon wants different-colored letters for residues that don't have HN
data -- maybe make a list of all residues and put that in the background
view of a pile with the existing sequence data view.

Need to avoid "squashing" of letters in sequence view -- try offsetting
diagonally?

Maybe add a cursor in the main view that highlights residues in the
residue view?
