	$Id$

Note: this is pretty preliminary right now.

- Make sure pep-version-history is up to date (make sure DEVise and
  JavaScreen client versions are correct).

- Make sure DEVISE_MIN_VERSION and JS_CLIENT_MIN_VERSION are up-to-date
  in S2DMain.java.

- Go through the testing procedure in "testing".

- Get rid of "x" part of version and recompile.

- Commit the sources.

- Recompile and install on teal, run test_all.

- Check at least one visualization on teal.

- Tag the sources with a tag of the form peptide_cgi_x_y_z, where
  x_y_z is the version.

- Archive the sources.

- Make the distribution tarball.

- Untar the distribution tarball, link the right Makefile.config.*, do
  a 'make setup testsetup', and finally do a test_all in cgi-bin.

- Put the distribution tarball into the appropriate /p/devise/ftp/Devise-*
  directory.

- Install on manatee at BMRB and test things, including the visualization
  server and visualization server restart IDs.

- Install the new version at BMRB and the mirror sites.

- Announce the release to BMRB and mirrors.

- Update /scratch/wenger/peptide_cgi_test and recompile.

- Increment the version in the sources (11.0.2 -> 11.0.3x1, for example).
