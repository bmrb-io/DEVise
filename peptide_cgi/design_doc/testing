			Testing Peptide-CGI
		$Id$

This testing must be done before any release of Peptide-CGI or DEVise/
JavaScreen.

The following testing steps must be done:

- Run make_view manually in cgi-bin.  Make sure it doesn't generate any
  error messages.

- Run test_all in cgi-bin.  Make sure all tests succeed.

- Install the relevant software on teal.

- Run test_all in /var/home/www/public/cgi-bin/bmrb on teal.  All tests
  except for test32 and test34 must succeed.  (Test32 and test34 can fail
  because they test for viewing unreleased entries, and the CGI directory
  on teal isn't set up for that.)

- Access the visualizations on teal via the following URL:
    http://devise.cs.wisc.edu/devise/bmrb/bmrb_select.html

- Run 's2d -bmrbid 4267 -force' in /var/home/www/public/cgi-bin/bmrb on teal.

- View the following visualizations for the entry 4267 and MAKE SURE THEY
  ARE CORRECT:
    - Chemical Shift Delta
    - Chemical Shift Index
    - Percent Assigned Atoms
    - Chemical shift distributions by amino acid
    - Simulated 1H-15N backbone HSQC spectrum
    - Assigned chemical shift ambiguity code data
    - T1 Relaxation (750 MHz)
    - Heteronuclear NOE (750 MHz) N H
    - Coupling constants
    - 3D structure from PDB ID 1NGL (make sure the Jmol menu button shows
      up in the JavaScreen)
    - S2 order parameters

- Run 'tests/test15 -noleech' in /var/home/www/public/cgi-bin/bmrb on teal.

- View the following visualizations for the entry 4317 and MAKE SURE THEY
  ARE CORRECT:
    - Difference Histograms
    - Differences by Residue
    - Observed vs. Calculated Chemical Shift Values

- Run tests/test3 in /var/home/www/public/cgi-bin/bmrb on teal.

- View the following visualizations for the entry 4081 and MAKE SURE THEY
  ARE CORRECT:
    - LACS Data (CA vs. CA-CB)
    - LACS Data (CB vs. CA-CB)
    - LACS Data (HA vs. CA-CB)
    - LACS Data (CO vs. CA-CB)

- Run 's2d -bmrbid 4096 -force' in /var/home/www/public/cgi-bin/bmrb on teal.

- View the following visualizations for the entry 4096 and MAKE SURE THEY
  ARE CORRECT:
    - 3D structure

- Run tests/test19 in /var/home/www/public/cgi-bin/bmrb on teal.

- View the following visualizations for the entry 6318 and MAKE SURE THEY
  ARE CORRECT:
    - Assignment figure of merit data
    - Follow the "Larger view" link and make sure it shows up correctly.

- View the following visualizations for the entry 4001 USING THE LARGE
  VISUALIZATIONS SUMMARY PAGE and MAKE SURE THEY ARE CORRECT:
    - 3D structure from PDB ID 1QLK [also make sure this shows up in
      the large size]
    - Chemical shift distributions by amino acid (from the first save
      frame) [also make sure this shows up in the large size]

- Go to http://devise.cs.wisc.edu/devise/bmrb/uvd/uvd_works.html and click
  the "Test" link.  Make sure the summary page is correct and some of
  the visualizations work.

- Test http://devise.cs.wisc.edu/devise/bmrb/histograms/histogram.html.

- Test http://devise.cs.wisc.edu/devise/bmrb/histograms/histogram2.html.

- Test http://devise.cs.wisc.edu/devise/bmrb/histograms/dna_histogram.html.

- Test http://devise.cs.wisc.edu/devise/bmrb/histograms/rna_histogram.html.


* Things to do to this document:

- Find an ambiguity code visualization that has more interesting values
  than 4267 does.

- Find a chem shift reference test that has all secondary structures (helix,
  sheet, and other).

- Maybe specifically list visualizations to test for UVD.
