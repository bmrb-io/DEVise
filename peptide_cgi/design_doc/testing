			Testing Peptide-CGI
		$Id$

This testing must be done before any release of Peptide-CGI or DEVise/
JavaScreen.

NOTE: when adding a new visualization, be sure to test color print and
black/white print display modes!

The following testing steps must be done:

- Run make_view manually in cgi-bin.  Make sure it doesn't generate any
  error messages.

- Run test_all in cgi-bin.  Make sure all tests succeed.

- Install the relevant software on teal.

- Run test_all in /var/home/www/public/cgi-bin/bmrb or
  /var/home/www/public/cgi-bin/bmrb_test as appropriate on teal.  All tests
  except for test32 and test34 must succeed.  (Test32 and test34 can fail
  because they test for viewing unreleased entries, and the CGI directory
  on teal isn't set up for that.)

- Access the visualizations on teal via the following URL:
    http://devise.cs.wisc.edu/devise/bmrb/bmrb_select.html
      or
    http://devise.cs.wisc.edu/devise/test/bmrb_test/bmrb_select.html
      as appropriate

- Run 's2d -bmrbid 4267 -force' in
  /var/home/www/public/cgi-bin/[bmrb|bmrb_test] on teal.

      residues in the data view correctly highlights them in the structure
      selection window and structure view.
    - The first two assigned chemical shift ambiguity code data

* Things to do to this document:

- Find an ambiguity code visualization that has more interesting values
  than 4267 does.

- Find a chem shift reference test that has all secondary structures (helix,
  sheet, and other).

- Maybe specifically list visualizations to test for UVD.
