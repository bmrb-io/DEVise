			Testing Peptide-CGI
		$Id$

This testing must be done before any release of Peptide-CGI or DEVise/
JavaScreen.

NOTE: when adding a new visualization, be sure to test color print and
black/white print display modes!

The following testing steps must be done:

- Run make_view manually in cgi-bin.  Make sure it doesn't generate any
  error messages.

- Run test_all in cgi-bin.  Make sure all tests succeed.

- Install the relevant software on teal.

- Run test_all in /var/home/www/public/cgi-bin/bmrb on teal.  All tests
  except for test32 and test34 must succeed.  (Test32 and test34 can fail
  because they test for viewing unreleased entries, and the CGI directory
  on teal isn't set up for that.)

- Access the visualizations on teal via the following URL:
    http://devise.cs.wisc.edu/devise/bmrb/bmrb_select.html

- Run 's2d -bmrbid 4267 -force' in /var/home/www/public/cgi-bin/bmrb on teal.

- View the following visualizations for the entry 4267 and MAKE SURE THEY
  ARE CORRECT:
    - Chemical Shift Delta
    - Chemical Shift Index
    - Percent Assigned Atoms
    - Chemical shift distributions by amino acid
    - Simulated 1H-15N backbone HSQC spectrum
    - Assigned chemical shift ambiguity code data (make sure data
      cursor shows up at correct initial size/location)
    - T1 Relaxation (750 MHz)
    - T2 Relaxation (750 MHz)
    - Heteronuclear NOE (750 MHz) N H
    - Coupling constants
    - 3D structure from PDB ID 1NGL (make sure the Jmol menu button shows
      up in the JavaScreen) (make sure data cursor shows up at correct
      initial size/location)
    - S2 order parameters

- Run 'tests/test15 -noleech' in /var/home/www/public/cgi-bin/bmrb on teal.

- View the following visualizations for the entry 4317 and MAKE SURE THEY
  ARE CORRECT:
    - Difference Histograms
    - Differences by Residue
    - Observed vs. Calculated Chemical Shift Values

- Run tests/test3 in /var/home/www/public/cgi-bin/bmrb on teal.

- View the following visualizations for the entry 4081 and MAKE SURE THEY
  ARE CORRECT:
    - LACS Data (CA vs. CA-CB)
    - LACS Data (CB vs. CA-CB)
    - LACS Data (HA vs. CA-CB)
    - LACS Data (CO vs. CA-CB)
    - Simulated 1H-13C HSQC spectrum

- Run 's2d -bmrbid 4096 -force' in /var/home/www/public/cgi-bin/bmrb on teal.

- View the following visualizations for the entry 4096 and MAKE SURE THEY
  ARE CORRECT:
    - 3D structure (make sure data cursor shows up at correct initial
      size/location)

- Run tests/test19 in /var/home/www/public/cgi-bin/bmrb on teal.

- View the following visualizations for the entry 6318 and MAKE SURE THEY
  ARE CORRECT:
    - Assignment figure of merit data (make sure data cursor shows up
      at correct initial size/location)
    - Follow the "Larger view" link and make sure it shows up correctly.

- View the following visualizations for the entry 4001 USING THE LARGE
  VISUALIZATIONS SUMMARY PAGE and MAKE SURE THEY ARE CORRECT:
    - 3D structure from PDB ID 1QLK (make sure data cursor shows up at
      correct initial size/location)
    - Chemical shift distributions by amino acid (from the first save
      frame)

- View the following visualizations for entry 5246:
    - The 3D structure visualization for 5246/1KMF; select data sets
      from the two different entity assemblies (e.g., HA delta chem shift
      [1] and HA delta chem shift [2]) and make sure that selecting
      residues in the data view correctly highlights them in the structure
      selection window and structure view.
    - The first two assigned chemical shift ambiguity code data
      visualizations -- make sure that the structure is the correct one
      for the given entity assembly ID, and selecting data highlights
      the residues correctly.

- (RNA) view the following visualizations for 15080:
    - Chemical shift delta for entity assembly 1.
    - 3D structure from PDB 2O33.

- (DNA) view the following visualizations for 15083:
    - Chemical shift delta for entity assembly 1.
    - 3D structure for PDB 2O8K (make sure that selection of data for
      the different entity assemblies works, and highlighting in the
      atom selection tree works).

- (SPARTA) Run 'tests/test_sparta5' in /var/home/www/public/cgi-bin/bmrb
  on teal.  View the following visualization for entry 16387:
    - SPARTA-calculated chemical shift deltas.  Make sure model # on
      drill-down matches model # selected with cursor, etc.

- Go to http://devise.cs.wisc.edu/devise/bmrb/uvd/uvd_works.html and click
  the "Test" link.  Make sure the summary page is correct and some of
  the visualizations work.

TEMPTEMP -- add stuff for torsion angle restraints!!
TEMPTEMP -- should be 4310 because of 2 entity assemblies
TEMPTEMP -- also 15209 (2 ent), 4416 (2 ent, na)
TEMPTEMP -- add stuff for restraint-only visualizations
TEMPTEMP -- test Force Reprocessing button for regular, uvd, and restraint-only

- Test http://devise.cs.wisc.edu/devise/bmrb/histograms/histogram.html
  (make sure drill-down works).

- Test http://devise.cs.wisc.edu/devise/bmrb/histograms/histogram2.html
  (make sure drill-down works).

- Test http://devise.cs.wisc.edu/devise/bmrb/histograms/dna_histogram.html
  (make sure drill-down works).

- Test http://devise.cs.wisc.edu/devise/bmrb/histograms/rna_histogram.html
  (make sure drill-down works).


* Things to do to this document:

- Find an ambiguity code visualization that has more interesting values
  than 4267 does.

- Find a chem shift reference test that has all secondary structures (helix,
  sheet, and other).

- Maybe specifically list visualizations to test for UVD.
