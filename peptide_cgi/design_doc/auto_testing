		Automatic Peptide-CGI Testing
	$Id$

Peptide-CGI is currently tested every night with an automatic test
script.

This is quite simple to do, following these steps:
1. Check out Peptide-CGI.
2. Build Peptide-CGI (see the building document).
3. Manually run cgi-bin/test_all and make sure it works.
4. Set up a cron job to run it every night.

Right now, the nightly tests are run in /scratch/wenger/peptide_cgi_test
on manta.cs.wisc.edu (but the exact location is not important for
the successful running of the tests).

This is the cron entry used to run the tests:

    08 23 * * * cd /scratch/wenger/peptide_cgi_test/peptide_cgi/cgi-bin;
      ./test_all

Once this is done, just keep updating the Peptide-CGI version as things
change, and monitor the emails from the cron job.
