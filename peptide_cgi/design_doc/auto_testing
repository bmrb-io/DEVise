		Automatic Peptide-CGI Testing
	$Id$

Peptide-CGI is currently tested every night with an automatic test
script.

This is quite simple to do, following these steps:
1. Check out Peptide-CGI.
2. Build Peptide-CGI (see the building document).
3. Manually run cgi-bin/test_all and make sure it works.
4. Set up a cron job to run it every night.

Right now, the nightly tests are run in /scratch/wenger/peptide_cgi_test
on manta.cs.wisc.edu (but the exact location is not important for
the successful running of the tests).

This is the cron entry used to run the tests:

    08 23 * * * cd /scratch/wenger/peptide_cgi_test/peptide_cgi/cgi-bin;
      ./test_all

TEMPTEMP -- need to update this for the test in
/p/devise/ext11/peptide-cgi_test/peptide_cgi

Once this is done, just keep updating the Peptide-CGI version as things
change, and monitor the emails from the cron job.


* COMMON PROBLEMS

The most common problem causing the automatic tests to fail has been
that sometimes the PDB site is unavailable, which causes tests involving
coordinate processing to fail.  (Obviously, this is assuming that the
Peptide-CGI code works correctly.  Assuming everything is tested before
committing changes, this should be the case.)  Note that some of the
tests can be run successfully without a connection to any web site,
so if *all* tests fail something else is wrong.
