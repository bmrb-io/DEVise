Miron today went to one of the BMRB histogram pages in Firefox, and
the JavaScreen didn't come up.  There also were no errors or anything
shown in the browser.  He thinks he has Java and/or JavaScript disabled,
and that's probably the cause of the problem.  Note:  this was on Windows.
Also, Miron ran things in IE, and it worked.  So it's clearly something
about his Firefox configuration -- 

Interesting, though -- I just tried this in Firefox on my laptop, and
there's a not-very-prominent "Block plugin"/"Allow" bar that shows up.
I wouldn't swear that that didn't show up when Miron ran things.
