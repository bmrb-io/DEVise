* Building Peptide-CGI

There are four basic steps in building Peptide-CGI:
1) Get the code.
2) Set up a config file.
3) Set up various directories, etc.
4) Compile the code.


Generally, you get the Peptide-CGI code by checking out the peptide_cgi
module from the repository in /p/devise/cvs at CS.  There are also source
code archives of releases in /p/devise/wenger/src_archive.


To set up a config file, you should copy or link the appropriate
Makefile.config.* to Makefile.config (take a guess depending on where
you're building the software).  Then modify Makefile.config as necessary
(the various config values are detailed in a separate document).


Once you have your Makefile.config set up, run the command:

    make setup testsetup

(You need to make the target testsetup to be able to run the automatic
test scripts.)


To actually compile the software, go into the src directory and run
the command:

    make all jar

If the compile works properly, you will end up with an s2d.jar file
in the src directory.
