				Bug 167
				2016-01-07

make_view and make_uvd allow arbitrary code to be executed by putting
it in backticks within arguments, for example:

  http://devise.cs.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/bmrb/make_view?number=1234`rm -r`

The fix for this is to call system(...) or probably open(EXEC, ...)
with indivdual arguments, instead of passing one big command string
via backticks.
