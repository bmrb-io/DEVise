				Notes on Bug 140
				2013-04-11

There are several issues going on with this:

1) The sequences in the BMRB file don't exactly match those in the PDB
file.  Most of the sequences match, but there are enough differences that
the matching algortithm doesn't consider them a match.

2) There are two entities, and both of them are heterogeneous monomers
(see the _Entity_poly_seq.Hetero tag).  That adds another level of
confusion to the matching and the display of the data.

3) Even if we can't match the BMRB and PDB sequences, we want to display
the structure (but highlighting won't work).  At this point, I'm not sure
where the non-matching data gets filtered out (I suspect maybe in the JS
client).

In the PDB (mmCIF) file, chains A and B are both entity 1, and chains
C and D are both entity 2.  (I'm wondering whether we only want to display
one chain for each entity -- I suspect things may get too confusing
otherwise.)  (Hmm -- which ones do the chemical shift data go with?)

You can find at least some entries with the _Entity_poly_seq.Hetero
tag by searching for non-standard monomers in the entity/entity tab of
the beta search interface (although 17960 doesn't show up for some
reason!).  There are a pretty large number of entries that show up
(athough it seems like most of them don't have multiple entity assemblies,
so the problem doesn't show up).

One thing I was wondering about is this:  in the "Atom Display" and "Atom
Selection" panels in the "Structure Selection" dialog, should I primarily
designate things by the PDB chain ID instead of the entity assembly ID?
I think I'd have to do that if we're going to display all of the coordinate
data, even if the sequence in the PDB data doesn't match the sequence in
the BMRB data.
