To-do 196: Get Java applet signed

Need to think about when this should happen in the overall build/release
process -- On each build?  On each install?  When making the distribution
tarballs?  We need at least an optional way to do it before making
the tarballs, for installs on teal -- I'd rather not have to make tarballs
for that every time.  (Hmm -- maybe that would be a good idea??)

Maybe have a question in 'make dist' about whether the jar files are
signed, like the question about whether they've been tested?

I think the signing should be done as the devise user, not as me, so
that possibly someone else can do it.

Check about how soon the unsigned applet ban will happen.  I just did
a little bit of checking and couldn't find a timeline.


Miron wants me to talk to OSG and SWAMP people about this in case they
have similar issues and have done any work on them.
