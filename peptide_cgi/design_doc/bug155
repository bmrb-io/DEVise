Maybe put dynamics movie stuff into uvd or some other subdirectory?
Although that might not totally solve it.  (The problem is that the
data for each entry doesn't have its own directory, so it's hard to
come up with an expression that will delete the right data for the
tests but not delete the dynamics movie data.)

Hmm -- another way to do it might be to name the dynamics movie stuff
something like dyn_movie_15451 instead of 15451_dyn_movie, because
we delete things with a command like this:  rm -r -f */15451*.
