* Peptide-CGI version history is now included in the distribution
tarball.

* The distribution tarball now untars into a directory whose name
includes the version.


Peptide-CGI 11.0.0
------------------
(Needs DEVise/JavaScreen 1.9.0 or higher.)

* 3D structures are rendered with Jmol, which gives much more advanced
rendering and more options.

* The atoms and residues to be displayed in the 3D view are selected with
a tree GUI in a separate window, rather than by cursors in the DEVise
visualization itself.

* There is also a tree GUI that can override the DEVise cursor selection
of which residues are highlighted in the 3D view.

* Visualization info in ambiguity code, Pistachio, and LACS sessions
now rendered on the client side.

* Got rid of kludges in chemical shift reference sessions required
for pre-1.7.19 DEVise versions. 

* Fixed problems with some html page titles being based on the BMRB
ID rather than the name, etc.  Fixed test36 to work with new LACS
file names.

* Disabled appropriate actions in various views that should have already
had this done.



Peptide-CGI 10.9.2
------------------
(Needs DEVise/JavaScreen 1.7.18 or higher.)

* Peptide-CGI now gets mmCIF files from the production PDB http site
as opposed to the beta ftp site.

* Added the dev_test makefile target to enable easy running of DEVise on
the sessions generated by Peptide-CGI for testing (needs the proper
DEVise startup script as well).

* Removed the "go back" option from the help pages, since we
open them in a new browser window.

* Added Florence config file.

* Changed LACS filename template because Dave changed .out to .str
in the names.  (This change was manually patched onto 10.9.1 at
Madison and Osaka.)

* Improvements to debug and error messages.


Peptide-CGI 10.9.1
------------------
(Needs DEVise/JavaScreen 1.7.18 or higher.)

* Fixed some bugs in the chemical shift index calculations:
    - We now use the individual CSI values in the consensus CSI
      formula, instead of just rounding the deltashift values.
    - We now take ambiguity codes into account when handling the
      special case for GLY.
    - Corrected "standard" chem shift value for CB in CYS (we had
      been using CYS (red) value and we should be using the CYS (ox)
      value).

* A bunch of changes to the Pistachio visualization:
    - Improved color selection.
    - Adjusted font sizes and window sizes slightly in the Pistachio
      visualization.
    - Added titles to more views to clarify things;
    - Changed JS background color so inter-view borders show up
      (also for ambiguity visualization);
    - H -> "backbone proton" in data select view;
    - Changed color select view and color legend view;
    - Unknown -> unassigned in color legend;
    - Moved unassigned to right in color legend;
    - Y axis label in data view.

* Updated config for marlin and Osaka to have LACS setup.


Peptide-CGI 10.9.0
------------------
(Needs DEVise/JavaScreen 1.7.18 or higher.)

* Support for LACS visualizations.

* The user now has the choice of viewing the visualizations at a size
of 800x600 pixels (now the default) or 1024x768 pixels.


Peptide-CGI 10.8.3
------------------
(Needs DEVise/JavaScreen 1.7.18 or higher.)

* Fixed a couple of bugs in the atomic coordinate, ambiguity code, and
figure of merit visualizations:  in one, moving the data value
cursor sometimes incorrectly changed the Y axis range in that view;
in the other, home on the data value views worked incorrectly.

* Added config files for Osaka and Florence.

* Configuration to get things to work on the 64-bit machine at BMRB
(including increasing the maximum Java memory).

* Added more tests, fixed a problem with one of the existing tests.

* Better error messages if we retry because of running out of
memory.


Peptide-CGI 10.8.2
------------------
(Apparently not released.)


Peptide-CGI 10.8.1
------------------
(Needs DEVise/JavaScreen 1.7.18 or higher.)

* Ambiguity code and figure of merit visualizations now use 2D main
views (this speeds up the JavaScreen).

* Changed "Pistachio" to "assignment figure of merit" in
visualizations, etc.

* Added atom type legend to coordinate visualization.

* Added figure of merit visualization help; updated the help for the
atomic coordinate and ambiguity code visualizations to match recent
changes; added stuff about the info view to some other visualization
help pages.

* Updated NMR-STAR version test for latest 3.0 version string format.

* Updates to how we get PDB IDs from NMR-STAR 3.0 files.

* Added the capability of viewing unreleased entries (for annotators).


Peptide-CGI 10.8.0
------------------
(Needs DEVise/JavaScreen 1.7.18 or higher.)

* Major improvements to NMR-STAR 3.0 support -- chemical shifts for
multiple entities are now handled correctly.

* Changed Pistachio percentage calculation to be relative to the number
of atoms that actually exist in each amino acid, not just the number
we have figures of merit for.

* The Pistachio visualization now comes up with "Color by figure of
merit" selected (instead of "Color by atom type").

* Added -dev_version flag that gives the minimum required DEVise
version for the current version of Peptide-CGI.
