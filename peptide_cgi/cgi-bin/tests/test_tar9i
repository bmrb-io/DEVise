# Testing torsion angles from remediated restraints.

# A new torsion angle test -- 4310 has 2 entity assemblies -- figured
# I should have a torsion angle test including that.

# TEMP: the restraints grid file for 1CKK has *two* save frames of
# torsion angles.  I need to figure out how to deal with them.
