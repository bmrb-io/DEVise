Note:  this page was created by doing a 'save as' of the BMRB home page
(web page, complete).  For some reason I wasn't able to get things to
work right when I just copied the relevant sources over from BMRB.

Also, I manually changed the visualization links to be relative rather
than absolute, so they go the relevant installation at CS rather than
linking over to BMRB.
