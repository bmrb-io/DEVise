For the original images, set the JavaScreen size to 320x240 (except 3D
ones are 400x300, because Jmol doesn't seem to work right if things
are too small).
Note: 320x240 original didn't work for ambiguity code visualization, either.

Icons are 200x150, with some of the visualization cropped out to emphasize
the "main" window.  Some of them have also been fixed up manually to
restore the axes, etc.

I'm saving the full-size images in case we ever want to make different-size
icons -- we can create them from the saved full-size images instead of
having to re-do the screen grabs...
