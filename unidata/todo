  Big To Do's:
        Enum's 
        Perl Code sections
            Format
            Reader
            Global
            etc.
        Reality Checker (do we have enough info to read data?)
        "list_of" - (Joins)

    nested seperator's with the same value.
        (leaf values have no seperator, sentinel only applied 
         when seperators differ between levels.)

    also, delimiter's with the same value being nested.

---------------------------------- 
  Testing:
    Converter's
    min/max
    use of Index with and w/o Rids, can we switch between using
        offsets and rids while remaining consistent?

---------------------------------- 
    Finding records:
        binary
            recsze (should just be length??)

        text
            recsze (no comments allowed)
            delimiter
            default delimitor ('\n')


    Whitespace messes up positioning info. Do not remove whitespace
    between a delimiter and the start of the next record.

    Start writing spliter functions, do them in vertical passes,
    to make sure you get something working.

        1) position/length :  Get it working assuming everything is
                              found via these operators.  Keep it
                              flexible, of course.

        2) seperator / whitespace

        2) whitespace / nothing (depends on types)

        3) generic - slower, but does anything/everything
