  Some tidbits to watch for in the UniData code (misc features):


  All data returned by UniData is guarenteed to be aligned properly.
  The alignment restrictions for various types is set in Config.h, btw.
  UniData is able to align the data without inserting oodles of padding
  by reordering the fields in the output record, putting the most
  restrictive items first, followed by next most, etc.  Thus padding is
  never required on a machine where the smaller alignment requirements
  are multiples of the larger ones (most machines I've seen).
  The schema provides an array of field offsets that corresponds to a
  field's position within the schema so that programs can understand
  the data.
