  The DEVise internal types should be (at least):

        int
        real  (currently "double")
        string

        unixtime
        date
        datetime

    others for consideration:
        color
        rational  (9 5/8)

  The why and how.

    int - Same as now.

    real - I suspect the term 'double' has little meaning to a user not
           familar with C; similarly, the term 'float' is inaccurate
           for a user that is.  The moniker "real" avoids both of these
           problems, without detailing how we are currently implementing it.
           If we decide at some point to support smaller or larger floating
           point formats, we can do so with a 'size' modifier, rather
           than generate more types.


   string - Same as now.

   unixtime - Same as the current 'date' format.

   date - The date only, 12/12/96.

   datetime - A timestamp,  12/12/96 12:12:55.


   The date and datetime formats should be stored internally with the
   ISO/ANSI "struct tm" defined in <time.h>; the format for reading
   should follow the conventions (or similar) as given in the  
   'strftime' man page for printing.

   Within the schema, a new 'date_format' field could be added to
   address reading of (nearly) arbitrary dates and times. 

   For Instance:

        date_format = '%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S';

   could be specified within a schema for a date/datetime/unixtime
   field; DEVise should handle the rest internally.
