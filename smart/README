smart.11.0.tar.Z  SMART version 11.0 (un-encrypted).
tar.cluster	Random clustering routines that do not work with the
		current SMART versions, but may be useful as a base
		for writing others.
trec1_eval.shar  Evaluation code which takes TREC results and TREC
                relevance judgements to produce SMART top-ranked
                evaluation output.  This code should be used for
                for comparing against TREC 1 results.
trec2_eval.shar  Evaluation code which takes TREC results and TREC
                relevance judgements to produce SMART top-ranked
                evaluation output.  This code should be used for
                for comparing against TREC 2 results.


The rest of the directories are the standard ir test collections, normally
containing document text, query text, and relevance judgements.
Warning: the "make_coll" routines included in these directories are
for old versions of SMART.  The newer versions of SMART include sample
collection indexing routines for all the collections.
