Hello, 

Here's the details on getting and installing SMART version 10.1.
Just a reminder that this is a beta-test version.  I don't expect
many bugs, but things are not yet packaged well enough for
someone with no information retrieval background to put up a
working system (eg, I don't ever define vector space model).
So please don't release details of how to get it to the general
public yet.

My goals for the beta-test period are
        1. weed out bugs
        2. weed out machine dependencies
        3. Find what areas of documentation need improving.
        4. Write several canned scripts that set up various
           collections (eg, archived news, routing news, etc.)
           Naive users should be able to just use those scripts.
        5. Add features that beta-testers convince me must be there!
        6. Add features that beta-testers implement.  

I'll post bug fix patches to the mailing list.  Features will be
added in an intermediate release 10.2 Beta in about a month, and
then the fully available release 10.3 several weeks after that.

Have fun with it!
                                        ChrisB

Installing SMART Beta version

If you don't have a copy of SMART, you can pick it up using 
anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.cornell.edu.

It's encrypted there.
        ~ftp/pub/smart/10.1.tar.Z.en

The following commands should get and then create the smart
directory hierarchy in your current directory:
% ftp ftp.cs.cornell.edu
Name: anonymous
Password: <your login name>
ftp> cd pub/smart
ftp> binary
ftp> get 10.1.tar.Z.en
ftp> quit
% crypt Fall.1961 <10.1.tar.Z.en | uncompress | tar xfv -
        
Let me know immediately if this doesn't work!

If you need any of the standard test collections, they're in
        ~ftp/pub/smart/<collection>
(non-encrypted).

To get smart running, you'll need to
1. Edit pathnames in
        src/makefile          - PREFIX needs changing
        src/makebin.templ     - PREFIX needs changing
        src/makelib.templ     - PREFIX needs changing
        lib/spec.default      - first line
        lib/spec.expcoll      - first line

2. Edit compiler options in 
        src/makefile
        src/makebin.templ
        src/makelib.templ 
It is currently set up to compile with non-optimized gcc.  You
should be able to just comment that section out, and uncomment
the cc section to switch to cc.  Note that you do not want
dynamic linking under Sun's cc (very slow).

3. Possibly edit 
        src/h/param.h
The only machine dependent define is
        #define MMAP
I don't know if mmap will work on non-Sun systems.  It's an
excellent option to have on Suns.

4. cd src 

5. Run "make makefiles" to construct the makefiles in the
subdirectories.  

6."make" 

7. Test by looking at 
        Sample/adi/test_adi
        Sample/adi/make_adi
Change pathnames as appropriate in make_adi, and run test_adi.
Test_adi indexes the adi collection (actually done through
make_adi), runs a pair of retrieval runs, and then
runs a set of commands through the user interface of smart.
Differences between your output and a copy of valid output are
reported.  There should be no differences reported except due to
pathnames and differences in lengths of files saved due to
pathnames.

8. There are some handy one-line shell scripts in "scripts".  You
may want to install them in an accessible place.  All will need
pathname changes.  I would recommend running 
        scripts/make_docsmart
to create an indexed collection of smart procedure documentation.
        scripts/docsmart
can then be used to access the collection, or you should be able
to use
        scripts/ismart docsmart
to run the full verson of smart on it, depending on how you set
things up.
        scripts/smprint 
is a handy shorthand for examining SMART objects.
  

To get a feeling for what smart is doing, read the documentation
in Doc/overview.  


Mail questions, comments, and problems to 
        smart-people@cs.cornell.edu
I'll be setting up an informal mailing list operating from that
address to all the Beta-sites.  Unless privacy is specifically
requested, I'll feel free to forward any questions/answers of
general interest to this mailing list.

For the near future, my work on the release will be confined to
improving documentation and fixing any bugs you find.  I'll
continue to add features to SMART as the features become useful
to us in our own research.  At the moment, I'm not planning any
research involving WAIS, or a good user interface, so those
features may depend on your participation, which is certainly
welcome!

SMART plus user contributions will be made freely available once
the beta-test is over, although the core of SMART will remain
copyright protected.

Ask lots of questions!  That's the way I'll get a feel for what
needs attention, especially for documentation.  (Although the
quantity of documentation has improved during the 10-day time lag
between submission of the original announcement to IR-LIST and
the publication there!)

Good luck!
                                        ChrisB
