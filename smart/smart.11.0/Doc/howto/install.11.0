Hello, 

Installing SMART Version 11.0

If you don't have a copy of SMART, you can pick it up using 
anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.cornell.edu.

        ~ftp/pub/smart/smart.11.0.tar.Z

The following commands should get and then create the smart
directory hierarchy in your current directory:
% ftp ftp.cs.cornell.edu
Name: anonymous
Password: <your login name>
ftp> cd pub/smart
ftp> binary
ftp> get smart.10.1.tar.Z
ftp> quit
% uncompress < smart.11.0.tar.Z | tar xfv -
        
Let me know immediately if this doesn't work!

If you need any of the standard test collections, they're in
        ~ftp/pub/smart/<collection>
Note that thanks to Bruce Croft and Karen Spark-Jones, we now
have the source of the NPL test collection to distribute.


To get smart running, you'll need to
1. cd install

2. Edit "makefile" to change the pathname and possibly other options

3. Possibly edit compiler options in 
        makefile.top
        makebin.templ
        makelib.templ 
(Choice of compilers is chosen in "makefile"; you shouldn't need to
edit these other files unless you have some special needs).

4. Possibly edit 
        src/h/param.h
The only machine dependent define is
        #define MMAP
I don't know if mmap will work on non-Sun systems.  It's an
excellent option to have on Suns.

5. Run "make"
This will construct all needed makefiles from the templates, and
then compile the system.  Finally the system is tested with
the test suite in src/test_adi; you should only get differences
in pathnames and in number of bytes when pathnames are written out.
If you get other differences, there was an error in the installation
procedure somewhere.



Mail questions, comments, and problems to 
        smart-people@cs.cornell.edu 
I'll be setting up an informal mailing list operating from that
address to all the sites taht have expressed an interest.  Unless
privacy is specifically requested, I'll feel free to forward any
questions/answers of general interest to this mailing list.

For the near future, my work on the release will be confined to
improving documentation and fixing any bugs you find.  I'll
continue to add features to SMART as the features become useful
to us in our own research.  At the moment, I'm not planning any
research involving WAIS, or a good user interface, so those
features may depend on your participation, which is certainly
welcome!

Good luck!
                                        ChrisB
