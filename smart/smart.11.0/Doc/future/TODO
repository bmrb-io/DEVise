SHORT-TERM
Add parse_mult, same as parse_std, except allows section.parsetype
to specify multiple ctypes for a con (con already in numeric form)
This allows extra weighting for titles, proper nouns.  (other ctype
will be stored in separate inv_file).

Add logging facility to inter.  Just capture all user keystrokes.

Need to put in "retrieve all docs above x sim".  Replace rank_tr?

User interface.

WAIS

MID-TERM
All documentation (including man) to be put into latex

getspec_perm() to get file creation permissions.

Convert dictionary to use trie instead of hash table.?

Better document deletion (and collection maintainence procedures in general)

Time to rewrite low-level routines in lib_database to use garbage collection,
possibly caching, possibly sparse indices, mmap.

Trie as smart objects.  Shouldn't have to include stemming trie in code,
should be database file like stopwords

Add parsing of dates (along with retrieval eventually)

write routines to construct dynamic "thesaurus" (list of statistically
related terms).

retrieve.req calls individual non-required ctypes, no rank_tr.
Then go through required ctypes, using rank_tr
Initially, just have one required ctype.
