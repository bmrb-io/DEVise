The beta-test release of SMART version 10 is now (finally!)
available.  If you wish to get a copy, send a note to me at
        chrisb@cs.cornell.edu

SMART is being made available via anonymous ftp only.  The
distribution is encrypted just to make sure the beta-test version
doesn't escape to the outside world!  The final release will be
freely available, although the code is copyrighted and is not
public domain.

The responsibilities of a SMART beta-test site are simply to ask
questions, report problems, and make comments. (And replace the
beta-test version when the public version comes out so I don't
have to deal with it anymore!)  There'll be a mailing list set up
to exchange information.

SMART is an implementation of the vector-space model of
information retrieval proposed by Salton back in the 60's.  The
primary purpose of SMART is to provide a framework in which to
conduct information retrieval research.  Standard versions of
indexing, retrieval, and evaluation are provided.

A secondary goal is to have an actual low end information
retrieval system available to users.  I'm not sure how to define
low end; the largest collection I've worked with was about 300
Mbytes of netnews.  Retrieval speed was reasonable, about a
second or two on a Sparc 1 for simple queries.  It uses natural
language queries.

SMART suffers from the advantages and disadvantages of most
academic research software.  It's designed to be extremely
flexible (as long as you know what you're doing!).  But it is
correspondingly not strongly optimized for any one particular
use.  The code is relatively straightforward and should run (with
possible minor modifications) on most UNIX systems of sufficient
size.  Our standard setup is a SPARC 1 with 12 Mbytes of memory.
A standard disadvantage of much academic software is
documentation, and SMART is no exception.  (Currently,
documentation consists of about 40 pages of overview material,
about 200 procedure descriptions in a "man"-like format, and
random other writeups on how to do various things.  It needs
more.)

SMART version 10 is a complete rewrite of the mid and top levels
of SMART version 8 (the last version we released).  About 5% of
the version 8 code is recognizable in version 10.  It's much more
flexible and easily modified, and the various modules have much
more potential for interaction than the old version.  (Getting
access to more information at retrieval time was a major reason
for the rewrite).

The beta-test release is not yet as fully featured as I would
like, but it seems reasonably solid.  We've been using it
exclusively for the past year.  New features are still being
added, but we've now reached the point where the existing
features are stable.  Features still missing include Pnorm
retrieval and clustering.

It still doesn't have a working X-windows interface; I'm hoping
someone out there might be interested in putting one up!  The
source includes a simple X-window interface for SMART version 9,
written by kind folks at Berkeley.  Unfortunately I don't have
the interface builder that was used, and so I haven't adapted it
for version 10.

Hope to hear from you!
