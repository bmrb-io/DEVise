The release of SMART version 11 is now (finally!)
available via anonymous ftp from  ftp.cs.cornell.edu.
        ~ftp/pub/smart/smart.11.0.tar.Z

SMART is being made available via anonymous ftp only.  For the time
being (until we work out a potential legal problem) it's being made
available for research use only.  We still hope the next release will
be available for all non-commercial use, although the code is
copyrighted and is not public domain.

SMART is an implementation of the vector-space model of
information retrieval proposed by Salton back in the 60's.  The
primary purpose of SMART is to provide a framework in which to
conduct information retrieval research.  Standard versions of
indexing, retrieval, and evaluation are provided.

A secondary goal is to have an actual low-medium end information
retrieval system available to users.  I'm not sure how to define
low end; the largest collection I've worked with was about 1200
Mbytes of newswire/other.  Indexing speed was reasonable, from
120 - 250 Mbytes per hour.  Retrieval speed was a second or two
on a Sparc 1 for simple queries.  It uses natural language
queries.

SMART suffers from the advantages and disadvantages of most
academic research software.  It's designed to be extremely
flexible (as long as you know what you're doing!).  But it is
correspondingly not strongly optimized for any one particular
use.  The code is relatively straightforward and should run (with
possible minor modifications) on most UNIX systems of sufficient
size.  Our standard setup is a SPARC 1 with 12 Mbytes of memory.
(For the large collection above, it was a Sparc ELC with 24 Mbytes).
A standard disadvantage of much academic software is
documentation, and SMART is no exception.  Currently,
documentation consists of about 40 pages of overview material,
about 200 procedure descriptions in a "man"-like format, and
random other writeups on how to do various things.  It needs
more.

SMART versions 10/11 are a complete rewrite of the mid and
top levels of SMART version 8 (the last version we released).
About 5% of the version 8 code is recognizable in version 11
It's much more flexible and easily modified, and the various
modules have much more potential for interaction than the old
version.  (Getting access to more information at retrieval time
was a major reason for the rewrite).

Version 11 is not yet as fully featured as I would like, but it
seems reasonably solid.  New features are still being added, but
we've now reached the point where the existing features are
stable.  Features still missing include Pnorm retrieval and
clustering.

It still doesn't have a working X-windows interface; I'm hoping
someone out there might be interested in putting one up!  The
source includes a simple X-window interface for SMART version 9,
written by kind folks at Berkeley.  Unfortunately I don't have
the interface builder that was used, and so I haven't adapted it
for version 10 or 11.  I know there are other people who were
going to attempt an interface, but I haven't heard back from them
yet. 

Hope to hear from you!
