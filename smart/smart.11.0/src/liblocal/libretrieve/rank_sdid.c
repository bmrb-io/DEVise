/********************   PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION   ************************
 *0 Keep track of top SIGNED ranked documents during a retrieval.
 *1 retrieve.rank_tr.rank_sdid
 *2 rank_sdid (new, results, inst)
 *3   TOP_RESULT *new;
 *3   RESULT *results;
 *3   int inst;
 *7 Add the new document to results.top_results if the similarity is
 *7 high enough.  Break ties among similarities by ranking the document
 *7 with highest docid first.  Unlike rank_did, this routine allows
 *7 similarities to be negative.
 *9 WARNING: SHOULD NOT BE USED.  Unless you know what you're doing, this
 *9 can easily introduce inconsistencies in the retrieval process (eg,
 *9 ranks of rel docs will not agree with ranks of top docs).
