Directory /smart/scripts
        Useful general purpose shell scripts.  These can be adapted
        to meet a site's particular needs.  All will need to have
        pathnames changed within them before they are usable.


docsmart*       Performs a retrieval on the set of smart
                procedure documentation with its arguments as
                the query.  Very useful for active researchers,
                as well as system administrators. See make_docsmart.
ismart*         Invokes smart in a bit more friendly way for
                naive users.
make_docsmart*  Creates a SMART database by indexing the comment
                headers from all the smart source.  Needed for
                both docsmart and make_docprint.
make_docprint*  Automatically creates (in a very simple and ugly
                form) a printable "man" type version of each
                procedure's documentation.  At one page per 
                procedure (lots of wasted space) this will run
                200 to 300 pages.  Needs the database created
                by make_docsmart.
smprint*        Short-cut to print out SMART relational objects.
                Usage is "smprint <obj_type> object_file". 
                A useful, but hackish, perversion of this is
                "smprint proc <prefix>"  which prints out all
                procedure names in the smart hierarchy.
