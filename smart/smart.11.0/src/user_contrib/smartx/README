A X11-R4 user interface for SMART written by V. Chiu and T. Li
under the direction of F. Gey at Berkeley.

Unfortunately, this was written using DevGuide (Sun interface
builder) and I don't have DevGuide here at Cornell.  They had a
version of SMART version 9; there have been changes since then
that I haven't been able to track.  The changes should be
reasonably mechanical, but you'll have to figure out where to
make them!  I hope somebody will pick this up, I don't have time
at the moment.
