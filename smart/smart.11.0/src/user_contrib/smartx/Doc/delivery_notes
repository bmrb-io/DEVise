We will send you the coded directory consisting all the files that we added or
changed, organied at the same structure as the previous version of SMART.

To get them, please follow these instructions:

1. Save the mail in a file say smartx.uue;

2. Delete heading from smartx.uue file;

3. Do "uudecode smartx.uue", the system will generate a file called smartx.tar.Z
   at the current directory;

4. Do "uncompress smartx.tar.Z";

5. Do "tar xvf smartx.tar smartx", the directory smartx contents all the 
   directories and files we have changed or added. Also a document directory.

6. Note that we implemented this x-interface to SMART using DevGuide, an x 
   interface builder. DevGuide is needed to run this interface.

Follow the instruction in the "integration_notes" file to incorporate xinterfaceto smart
