For SMART:

1. For our interface, we would like to have the full-length titles displayed
   in our scrollable window. 

2. Two advanced functions don't seem to be working: Raw_doc and Qtext, even if
   we run them in the old version.

3. We were going to have a keyword collection as an option for the user to
   select a keyword or a few keywords instead of typing in a natural language,
   but SMART doesn't have any access to sorted objects.

4. If we do "make makefiles" in src.new/, it will also overwrite the makefile
   in libx/, which we don't like to do.  Can we do anything about this?

5. Also, if we do "make clean" in src.new/, it will not clean the libx.a file
   in lib/.  Where should be modified?

6. If we want to highlight the keywords when we display the titles or the
   documents, we need the keywords that are stemed by the system for the
   retrieval.

7. To change the document collection(specification file) without quiting SMART.


For the X interface:

1. To highlight the keywords when we display the titles or the documents.
   (need to learn how to mark positions in panels and changing backgrounds 
    for particular words.)

2. To add a horizontal scrollbar in the list panel of the main window for 
   viewing titles in full length.

3. To develop the "keyword" function.

4. To add two message panels in the document window and the advanced function
   window, similar to the message panel in the basewindow.

5. To add an advanced fuction that allows the user to change the document 
   collection(specification file) instead of re-invoke smart.

6. To split the interface files into smaller ones. Right now, we added our
   all interface procedures to the template callback function files 
   generated by gxv, DevGuide's companion program.  The file that we
   consider is "too long" is smart_xmain.c which has over 1000 lines of code.
