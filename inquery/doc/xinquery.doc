1.0  OVERVIEW

Xinquery is an X interface to the INQUERY retrieval engine using Tcl/tk X
application prototyping tools.  The actual retrieval engine application is
contained within the "tclinq" program.  Xinquery is merely the front end to
this program.  

  NOTE: "tclinq" must be on your path when you run xinquery.  You may specify
        a specific tclinq with a ".tkinqrc" file.

The tclinq program will accept database retrieval commands and allows for
customized startup files.  Some details to this aspect of xinquery is
available in the Help menu within xinquery itself, but it will not be covered
in this document.

The xinquery interface provides access to most all of the functionality
available from the INQUERY retrieval engine.  Pull-down menus allow for
definitions of collections, formulation of queries and browsing of terms, as
well as buttons defining how searches are to proceed and selection of
documents for display. 

This document will describe the command line options available for invoking
xinquery, defined environment variables, the layout of the interface, a sample
use of the interface and a description of menu items and navigation buttons.


2.0  XINQUERY COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

The xinquery command line options allow database definition, initialization
scripts for defining xinquery behavior and some tclinq settings.

  xinquery [-mono | -monochrome | -color] [Database] [Initscript] [-defaults]
           [-default_colors] [-usage]  
   
    Database              The name of the database to use. Unlike other INQUERY
                          programs, the database definition is via the inf file
                          and MUST include the ".inf" extension.

    -mono|-monochrome     Define a monochrome display. 

    -color                Define a color display.  This is the default.

    Initscript            The name of an initialization script that is 
                          to be run prior to running xinquery. 

    -defaults             Display values for global variables that may be set
                          from an initialization file (e.g. .tkinqrc).  This
                          selection will also offer to create a start-up
                          .tkinqrc file.

    -default_colors       To find out about the default color settings.
                          Useful for defining color values in a users
                          .Xdefaults file.

    -usage                Print a usage description but do not invoke
                          xinquery.  We use "-usage" in this program because
                          "-help" is defined for Tcl options.


3.0  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

There are a series of environment variables known by INQUERY applications.
These variables primarily define the location of files that might be needed
for application startup or use during a session such as stopword list files
and database storage locations.  The xinquery interface knows about about many
of these variables and if they are defined by the user, they need not be
specified on a command line, or the application may be run outside of database
locations. 


DOCSTOPS

This environment variable defines location of the default stopword file.  The
default is called "default.stp".  If a stopword list is not explicitly defined,
the xinquery (and other INQUERY) applications will look for
$DOCSTOPS/default.stp and use this as the list if stopping is active.
Define DOCSTOPS as a sh variable using (csh) setenv or (sh) set command.  One
may also place the definition in the appropriate shell startup file.

   setenv DOCSTOPS /usr/data/inquery/mydata

If this environment variable is not defined and one is not explicitly entered,
then xinquery will proceed without using stopwords, with possibly inconsistent
results. 


INQDATA

INQDATA defines a root database directory.  Residing in this directory may be
many subdirectories containing INQUERY databases.  The databases need not
actually reside within these sub-directories on Unix systems.  One may use
symbolic links to point to outside locations where other databases reside.
INQDATA is merely the starting location in which to look for INQUERY data.
This is the location xinquery will go to provide the user with a list of
available databases for selection.


INQ_HELP

Set this environment variable to the directory where xinquery help files are
located.  Originally they are located as a sub-directory in the inquery/doc
directory of a release.  If this variable is not defined, then no help can be
viewed when clicking xinquery's help button.


4.0  XINQUERY INTERFACE DESCRIPTION

In this section we will describe the xinquery format and then provide a simple
example of its use.  Finally, details of xinquery menu options and button
functions will be provided.


4.1  Interface Regions

The xinquery interface is laid out into several regions from top to bottom.
Each region provides certain functionality to the user such as menu
selections, retrieval summary, document text display and document navigation.

The upper region is the menu selection area.  It contains menu options across
the top of the interface that define user interaction with the INQUERY
retrieval engine.  

The next area is a results summary bargraph, displaying a histogram of a
number of retrieved documents, with the current active document (the first
document or the current user selected document) highlighted.  The histogram
shows the relative range of "relevance" or score of documents to one another.
This can be useful in deciding how many of the top documents are worth looking
at.  Usually, the first two or three documents will be significantly higher
ranked than those that follow.  The actual minimum and maximum document score
is also shown in this display.  Although the scoring is not absolute, keep in
mind that a default score is 0.4 (range 0.4 through 1.0).  A document with
this value is a "so-so" document.  The higher the score, the more likely its
relevance to the query.

Immediately to the right of the retrieval summary histogram is the query
region.  This is where the user should type the query to be put to the system.
A line immediately below displays the current collection and INQUERY server
name in use and provides buttons to clear the displays or run the query.  You
must push the "Run Query" button to submit the query for retrieval.

The next area down the interface page is the document summary region.  This
region provides listings (five at a time) of retrieved documents.  Each
document line provides information as to the documents retrieval rank, its
actual retrieval score, external ID and its title if present.  To the extreme
left of each entry is a check box marked "RF".  The user may click the box to
indicate a "relevant" document if relevance feedback is to be performed.
Relevance feedback uses these relevant marked documents as sources of
information for finding other similar documents for the user.  Scroll bars to
the right side of this area allow scrolling through the retrieved list of
documents.  The current active document will be highlighted or underlined.
This will correspond with the marked histogram in the bargraph display.  If
the user selects another document, its title line will become highlighted and
the bargraph highlighting will change accordingly.

The text area below the retrieval summary area will contain text corresponding
to the currently selected document.  Words within this text that match query
terms will be highlighted, allowing the user to more easily locate relevant
sections of text.  A scroll bar to the right provides navigation ability over
long documents.

Finally, at the bottom of the interface window, a set of navigation buttons
allow the user to jump to "relevant" sections of text, either by matching
query terms or overall best document passage, and for moving between retrieved
documents.   The "Next Keyword" button allows moving among matching query and
document text terms while the "Show Best Passage" button highlights an entire,
user defined length, of text where the best text match with the query
occurred.  This is especially useful for long documents of many, many pages,
allowing the user to proceed immediately to the locations matching the query.

A simple picture of the xinquery interface window and its regions is provided
below.  In this particular example, the interface is as it would appear using
the 1963 Time Magazine collection, provided in the INQUERY release, after
submitting the query, "John F. Kennedy".  The interface bargraph shows that
the first, highest ranked document scored 0.537 and the lowest 0.41 (pretty
close to the default 0.4 and thus probably not very good).  The query region
contains "John . Kennedy".  This is because the term "F" wasn't found in the
database and was dropped from the parsed query.  The retrieval summary region
contains five titles with the first one highlighted as active.  The text
window contains the text of this first document with matching query terms
hight-lighted.  In this particular case, the "John" query term matches both
Pope "John" XXIII as well as "John" F. Kennedy.  One could use the Query menu
selection to refine the query to filter out "unwanted John's" from the
retrieval.

4.2  Xinquery Menu Options

This section describes the operation and use of each of xinquery's menu
commands, buttons and double clicking actions.  Menu commands are organized
from left to right across the top of the window.  A description of each
command within the menu item will be covered in the order in which they
appear. 


File Menu Item

  The File menu item provides control over file actions.  These actions
  include loading queries from a specified file, saving queries developed
  during a session to a file, saving the contents of a retrieved document and
  quitting the program.

  Load Query

    Load a file containing queries into xinquery.  The contents of the file
    specified will be used as the query and displayed in the query window,
    just as if the user had typed it there.  This is extremely useful for long
    and complex test queries or for queries containing character sets that can
    not be typed.  Obviously, any query containing such characters (e.g.
    diacritics) would have had to been built with them recognized and
    processed in specified ways.

  Save

    Save the object of interest to file.  The object of interest may be a raw
    query, a parsed query (one which has been parsed by the query processor
    resulting in possible stopping, stemming or query transformation), or
    saving the text of a retrieved document.  When saving to file, the text is
    appended to the file rather than overwriting it.
			
    Save Query		Save the query displayed in the query window to a
                        file.

    Save Parsed Query   Save the parsed query displayed in the parsed query
                        window to a file.  
				
    Save Document       Specify a file to save the document displayed in the
                        document text window.

  Quit 

    Quit the xinquery session.


Collection Menu

  This menu lists the collections in the directory specified by the INQDATA
  environment variable.  The list is built by finding all collections in
  directories and subdirectories within the $INQDATA starting point.  This
  list of databases is alphabetized and then the collection subdirectory and
  collection (database) base name is saved and presented in a list for user
  selection.  The user clicks the selection box for the collection that is to
  be opened and queried.

  One may access INQUERY databases that are not contained within the $INQDATA
  directory subtree by choosing "Other...".  This will allow the user to
  navigate to a location where the database resides.  If the collection
  directory is empty, i.e., does not contain any collections, or if the
  INQDATA environment variable is not set to the collections directory,
  one must use the "Other" selection to access a database.

  The Collection menu may also be used to define a multi-database (MDB)
  xinquery session.  In this mode, the user will be presented with a list of
  databases to be marked as "active".  Then, queries will be submitted
  separately to each of the database and the results merged before being
  presented to the user.  There must be an INQUERY Connection Server active
  for MDB sessions to be possible.  

  The Collection indicator below the query box will indicate the name of the
  currently active collection, or if in MDB mode, will say "Multi DB".  In MDB
  mode, the Collection menu will offer "Multi DB" or "Single DB" options to
  allow passing back and forth between the two types of retrieval during one
  xinquery session.  Select "Multi DB" to display the current active
  databases.  A "Collection" definition of "?????" means a collection has not
  been defined, an must be, before retrieval may proceed.


Query Menu

  A series of query manipulation and definition selections are available with
  this menu topic.  The user may view the parsed query, define the number of
  documents the query is to retrieve, the size of the text passage to be used
  if passage viewing is enabled or a spell checking, or more aptly, "term
  checking" toggle may be set.  Furthermore, query transformers may be
  selected as active or not and finally, a query form may be invoked to aid
  the user in formulating a more precise query before submitting it to the system.

  Show Parsed Query     Displays a window containing the current query as it
                        appears after processing by the query parser.  In this
                        form, the query may possibly have terms removed or
                        operators added.

  Run Query             Runs the query shown in the query window.  One may
                        accomplish the same result by selecting the "Run
                        Query" button below the query window, or by typing a
                        "quick" double RETURN when typing the end of the
                        query. 

  Mode                  Gives a sub-menu that lets you select the desired mode
                        for retrieval.  Retrieval modes are by Document,
                        Passage, or Both.  Retrieval by passage returns
                        documents ranked by best passage rather than the
                        entire document contents.

  Number of Top Docs    Produces a sub-menu that allows definition of the
                        maximum number of top documents to be returned for
                        viewing.  The default value is 50 documents.

  Words per Passage     Select the number of words that will define a passage.
                        The default value is 200 words.

  Spell Checking        Turns spell checking on or off. If the query contains
                        a word that is not in the collection index and spell
                        checking is on, xinquery produces a dialog that lets
                        the user change the word.  If it is off, it ignores
                        the word (without warning you).  Note that spell
                        checking is not a true check for spelling errors.  It
                        simply refers to a query term not being found in the
                        database, possibly because it is mis-spelled.  The
                        default action is ON.

  Query Processing      Turns query processing on or off.  It is ON by
                        default.  Query processing means activate the selected
                        query transformers.

  Transformers          Activate or deactivate the various transformers

                        (stop_phrases, location, hyphens_caps, etc.) on or off
                        individually.  If any transformers are active, the
                        query may be automatically re-written by the addition
                        or deletion of terms or query operators.  One may see
                        the result of the transformations by looking at the
                        parsed query result.

  Query Form            Brings up a dialog window that allows the construction
                        of a query.  The query may be defined in terms of word
                        or phrase weights or field index definitions.  One may
                        examine and reformulate the query before actually
                        submitting it for processing.



  The "Query Form selection will offer up a form as shown below, in which the
  user may use natural language, or enter text a term or phrase at a time to
  be formed into a more powerful structured query.

  The query formulated as a result of the above form elements, using the CACM
  database included in the INQUERY release is:

       #BANDNOT(
          #BAND (
             #OD3( inform retriev )
             #OD3( oper system)
          )
          databas
       )

  This query has been automatically wrapped in a "boolean and" operator,
  "ordered distance of 3" operators, all within a "boolean and not" operation.
  The query terms have also been stemmed.  This is the query as it would be
  submitted to the retrieval engine.  Note also that the "microsoft" term has
  been dropped from the query.  In fact, if this query were submitted, with a
  "microsoft" term, a browser window would pop up allowing refinement of the
  term entry.  This CACM database is from the "pre-Microsoft Era".  There is
  no such term in this database.

  The Query Form controls are described below.

    Show Parsed Query    Display the parsed query, in a sub-window.

    Run Query            Run the query.

    Field Names          If field based retrieval is available for this
                         collection, then this is a pull-down menu with
                         possible field names as choices.  The corresponding
                         browser is displayed for selecting values for the
                         field along with valid operators.  If field based
                         retrieval is not available for the open collection,
                         this button is disabled.

    Help                 Display help screens.

    Cancel               Cancel the query form window.  The next time this
                         window is invoked, it will come up with the prior
                         contents rather than as empty.

    Clear                Clear the content of the query form and resets each
                         of the associated weights to "Low".

    Weight Buttons       A button to the left of each term or phrase entry

                         assigns weights to the term(s) contained in the
                         entry.  The weights are "Low", "Med", "high", "Req"
                         and "Not".  Each click on this button cycles through
                         these weight values.  The values give term weights of
                         1, 2 and 3 to the associated term(s).  A weight of
                         "Req" wraps the term(s) with a boolean "and" (#BAND)
                         operator signifying they are required.  A "Not" value
                         wraps the query terms with a boolean "and not"
                         (#BANDNOT) operator to eliminate documents containing
                         these terms.  It is an error to have all term or
                         phrase weights of "Not".

  Empty query forms do not contribute to the resultant query.  Hitting RETURN
  focuses the next form element, or if the default four elements are full,
  will create another new, empty, element.

  If there is more than one form element with the same weight, they will be
  grouped together with a common weight.  Terms inside a single form element
  are grouped with a prox 3 (#3) operator.  A prox 3 is chosen instead of the
  "phrase" (#PHRASE) operator because it will guarantee that all the terms
  occur (or does NOT occur if surrounded by a "Not" weight value) in the
  retrieved document.


Document Menu

  This menu contains commands for navigating within and between retrieved
  documents and their text.  This primarily involves moving to text terms or
  passages that match query terms.

  Show Next Keyword     Scroll the document text window to make the next
                        matching query term visible.

  Show Next Document    Display the next document in the document text window.

  Show Previous Document
                        Show the previous document in the document text
                        window. 

  Show Best Passage	Scrolls the document text window to make the "best
                        passage" (the passage best matching the query)
                        visible. 

  Show Next Best Passage
                        Scroll the document text window to make the next best
                        passage visible.  If the second best passage is
                        in view, then this selection will show document text
                        containing the third best passage if it exists.

  Show Previous Best Passage
                        Scroll the document text window to the previous best
                        passage.

  Highlighting Mode
			(Currently disabled.)

  Clear Relevant Documents
                        Clear the relevance feedback check marks (RF check
                        boxes) for all the documents. 

  Find                  Search for a character string.  Currently, only the
                        first word of the string is used.


Windows Menu

  Select this menu item to view the current list of warnings that have been
  generated during the session.  One may also view the query history, or clear
  all windows or queries.  A Tcl selection allows direct access to the Tcl
  interpreter via Tcl commands.  These commands are currently not discussed in
  this document although the xinquery Help Menu does provide some information
  about this feature.

  nn Warnings           Show a window containing any warning messages
                        generated during the xinquery session.  "nn" is the
                        number of errors accumulated so far, e.g. "2
                        Warnings". 

  Tcl                   Display a window for directly typing Tcl commands,
                        including commands to change settings of some of the
                        xinquery global variables.

  Query History         Display a list of the queries issued thus far during
                        the xinquery session.

  Clear All Windows     Clears the bargraph, the query text, retrieval
                        summary and document text areas of the interface.

  Clear/Restore Query   If there is a query in the query text area, clear it.
                        If not, restore the most recent query.

Browse Menu

  The browser menu offers access to the known field and global database terms
  for the current collection database.  A browser allows a user to enhance the
  query with terms from specified areas of the text, or by allowing query
  terms to be more correctly defined.  The selections in this menu item will
  correspond to the field indexes created when building the database, and
  always the global term database.  There may also be browser entries for
  InFinder databases or concept files.  For the Time Magazine database
  included with the INQUERY release, the following browser selections are
  possible. 

  stem (stem)

    A list of the terms (actually stems since the collection was built using
    stemming).  This browser file is available with every database and allows
    a user to know what sort of terms are available (or unavailable) for use.
    In our "John F. Kennedy" example, the "F" was dropped from the query
    because it does not exist in the database.  If one browses the stem
    selections, on will not find an "F" term entry (or any single letter
    entry).

  Document Title (TITLE)

    Terms contained in the TITLE field of documents.  Note that this is not
    the same as a listing of document titles in the collection, although one
    could build such a browser file for use.  Retrieval of documents by title
    terms would be via a TITLE field query.

  External Doc Id (DOCID)

    A listing of the external IDs of documents in the collection.  Retrieval
    of documents of external ID would be via a DOCID field query.

  Document Date (DDATE)

    A listing of the document dates, in canonical form (as well as
    sub-components which are generally not useful), appearing in the
    collection.  Retrieving documents by date would involve a query of the
    DDATE field.

  Content Date (CDATE)

    A listing of the content dates, in canonical form, that appear in the
    collection.  A content date is a date that appears in document text as
    opposed to a special, document date field as with DDATE above.  Retrieving
    documents by date would involve a query of the CDATE field.

  Selecting one of the browser files offered will result in a Browse
  Dictionary sub-window appearing.  This window contains the name of the
  dictionary, e.g. DDATE with a listing of the terms and their frequency in
  the collection.  A text entry box is available for searching particular
  strings as prefixes, substrings or other forms.  Buttons are available for
  navigating through the term lists and for appending them to the current
  query.

  The browser window shown below resulted from a prefix search of the Time
  Magazine collection for the term "si".  One would like to find information
  about Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia, but was uncertain how to spell the word,
  or even if such an entry was in the database.  Because the list of terms
  does not always appear precisely centered on the search term or where the
  search term would have been if it existed, one may have to scroll through
  the display several screens to get to the desired location in the list.

  The bottom button may vary somewhat from that displayed above because of the
  type of browser file available.  The "titles" button may or may not present
  document titles in which the term resides.  It may be replaced by a "query"
  button that will actually query the browser file producing possibly related
  terms.


Server Menu

  This menu lists known machines that may be serving INQUERY databases.  The
  retrieval engine will execute on the chosen machine if possible.  Note that
  the user should have permission to execute rsh on the selected machine.
  (Currently, a list of selected machines at CIIR is compiled into XInquery,
  and there's no way for a user to change it.)  ?????


Help Menu

  This menu initially starts with the "Show Context Help" selection.  Choosing
  this item produces a description of whatever "widget" the mouse is pointing
  to.  It will also change the selection item to "Hide Context Help" allowing
  the user to toggle context help as needed.  Each of the other commands in
  this menu produces a window containing help text on the selected topic.
  These items include "About Xinquery", "Using Xinquery", "About Inquery",
  "Query Formulation", "Xinquery Preferences" and "Xinquery's TCLINQ".  Some
  of these selection offer still further selection items.


4.3  Xinquery Buttons

A series of buttons appears on the xinquery interface window.  These allow the
user to navigate about documents and document text, as well as manage the
query and retrieval regions of the window.

  Clear Rel Docs        Clear the relevant document ("RF") box selections.
                        This is the same as the "Clear Relevant Documents"
                        selection from the Document menu.

  Clear/Restore Query   Toggle between clearing the the query text region or
                        restoring the last defined query text to the region.

  Run Query             Run the query that currently appears in the query text
                        area.  Same as Query menu selection with the same name.
		
  Show Next Keyword     Scroll to the next matching query term in the document
                        text area.  Same as Document menu selection with the
                        same name.

  Show Best Passage     Go to the best passage in the current document text.
                        Same as the Document menu selection with this name.

  Next Best             Go to the next best passage in the current document
                        text.  This is the same the Document menu "Show Next
                        Best Passage" selection.

  Prev Best             Go to the previous best passage in the current document
                        text.  This is the same the Document menu "Show Previous
                        Best Passage" selection.

  Next Doc              Go to the next document in the retrieval list.  This
                        is the same as the Document menu "Show Next Document"
                        selection. 

  Prev Doc              Go to the previous document in the retrieval list.
                        This is the same as the Document menu "Show Previous
                        Document" selection. 


4.4  Double Clicking

In the bargraph window, double clicking on any bar displays the corresponding
numbered document in the document text area.

Similarly, in the document title area, double clicking on any title displays the
corresponding document in the document text area.
