- Integrate new layout editor - DONE to be tested extensively.
  -unrivet ?  -DONE
  -screwed up when going from Grid to Custom and editing during restore 
  -precision errors due to cast from double to int :(.
  -Custom - Pile - Unpile (puts the views one on top of the other - 
                           make it a grid instead)
  - Save layout state in Custom Layout so that unpile can restore from it.
    However if views have been added then there is no intuitive way of 
    placing them in custom mode without user input
  - Piling only some child views in a view (Mixed layout ??) 
  - Opaque v/s transparent piling (stack v/s pile)

- Pile display - flip  - DONE

- Side panels  - take into account scrollbar sizes to get rid of hor scrollbr
  -visual links - DONE 
  -record links - DONE   - distinguish unlink and split
  -cursors  - DONE (should add x, y attribute to cursor)
  -schemas and TData - DONE
  -mappings - DONE

- Showing info about 
  -links and cursors ??? - DONE    (X-Y Links to be done)
  - different colors for different links ?
  - show axis for visual links 
  - If piles are present ??  
  -mappings
  -tdatas

- Open/Save Sessions  - DONE
  - loading/saving Layout info, DEViseViewPeer creation/destruction
  - save as ??
- Remember the groups and rivets created as part of the editing process - 
  (Problem : if the parent's layout changes thus changing the
size of currentView, then the saved layout state is invalid
even though the rivets and group can be maintained !!
maybe restoring the layout State should involve updating the
positions and sizes of boxes while maintaining groups and rivets?)

- Toolbars, Popup Menus - DONE
- Keyboard shortcuts - 
- Customize the colors etc - PARTIAL (Backgrounds/Foregrounds of windows)

- Print ??

Bugs
====
-Current View Selection does not happen correctly when the hierarchy is
more than 2 levels deep
-Some links are drawn with dotted lines...

Cleanups in the code :
-----------------------
- make DEViseLayout derived class of DEViseObj ??
- remove DEViseType from DEViseObj and use Java reflection API instead
- check the sizes of various components, Frame resize handler ?? DONE
- use serializeInfo to recreate view hierarchy instead of using the 
  roundabout method used right now. DONE
- make the read and write of categories more symmetrical... have to think
  about this.  NOT REQUIRED
- deleting tables and schemas through respective browsers ....if these
  are used in active tables/mappings...?? More error checking....
- port to NT  ??


Garbage Collection Anomalies :
------------------------------

The DEViseSessionPeer and DEViseViewPeer objects never get GC'ed. There
is a cyclic dependency between these and I tried hard to break it to
force GC but the finalize method never seems to get called...

In fact if all's well, setting m_thisSession = null should automatically
GC all the session objects. Doesnt happen!! Seems like there is a reference
to the session object remaining somewhere.
