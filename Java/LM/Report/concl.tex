\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:concl}

In this thesis, we developed a meta-visualization framework for DEVise.
We designed a user-interface in Java to create and understand DEVise
sessions. In the process, we came across cleaner ways of implementing
some of the DEVise idioms. Interesting ideas for future work include
implementing session templates and macros and a full-fledged Java
client for DEVise. The framework we have right now is only the tip of the
iceberg - a lot of imaginative research needs to be done to come
up with better meta-visualization metaphors for various DEVise idioms.
