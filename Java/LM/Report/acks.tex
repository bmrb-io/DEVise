\section{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank my advisors, Prof. Miron Livny and Prof. Raghu 
Ramakrishnan for giving me an opportunity to work with them on the
DEVise project and for the many insightful discussions we have had
regarding various aspects of DEVise. Working with an existing code base and 
a large group of people was a new experience for me and an extremely
 instructive one. I am grateful to the entire DEVise group at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison for giving me access to the DEVise software. Many thanks to
Kent Wenger and Jussi Myllymaki for helping me understand the DEVise code
and to Kevin Beyer, Donko Donjerkovic and Chris Weaver for their feedback
at various stages during implementation. I also appreciate Kent's help in
printing color images for the report.
