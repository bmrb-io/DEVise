Other files :

Catalog : The dummy catalog for the data tables
Schema directory : contains schema files 
Session directory : session files 
                
Currently the schema directory, session directory etc are static variables in the LMgr.java 
class in LayoutMgr.Application package. These should be made environment variables or config
parameters in a later version. 

Documentation : 

Code that is not self-explanatory has been commented with HTML tags. Userman.html is a very
brief user manual. For a conceptual description check out the masters thesis :
A Meta-Visualization Framework for DEVise by Shilpa Lawande. (See directory Java/LM/report under
devise srces). Implementation comments and a list of bugs and unimplemented features is
maintained in LayoutMgr/Application/TODO.
