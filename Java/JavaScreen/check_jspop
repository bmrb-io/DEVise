#  Revision 1.29.2.1  2006/05/03 16:48:22  wenger
#  Changed JavaScreen scripts from sh to bash because of problems
#  at Osaka -- their sh didn't accept the -e test.
#
#  Revision 1.29  2005/12/06 20:00:21  wenger
#  Merged V1_7b0_br_4 thru V1_7b0_br_5 to trunk.  (This should
#  be the end of the V1_7b0_br branch.)
#
#  Revision 1.28  2002/06/17 19:40:15  wenger
#  Merged V1_7b0_br_1 thru V1_7b0_br_2 to trunk.
#
#  Revision 1.27.8.5  2005/11/15 17:13:58  wenger
#  A bunch of changes to improve restart logging, etc.:
#  - Better error messages in jss.java.
#  - Set maximum memory for all production Java server processes to
#    256 MB (because of weird problems on marlin.bmrb.wisc.edu).
#  - DEVise.jspop and DEVise.jspop.loc send all start_devised output to
#    a log file instead of to /dev/null.
#  - check_jspop now puts check_connect.err.* in logs and doesn't
#    delete it when there's an error.
#  - run_check puts *starting* timestamp at beginning of output, saves
#    output from failed tests to logs.
#  - start_devised generates more output, now that it's being saved.
#  - Better error messages from check_jsall, check_jspop, and check_jss.
#
#  Revision 1.27.8.4  2004/11/09 16:02:35  wenger
#  Check_jspop now always deletes the check_connect.err.* file.

#  Merged jspop_debug_0405_br_2 thru jspop_debug_0405_br_4 to the
#  V1_7b0_br branch.
#
#  Revision 1.27.8.2.10.3  2004/09/03 17:26:32  wenger
#  Fixed problems with possible output file name conflicts.
#
#  Revision 1.27.8.2.10.2  2004/07/01 17:54:25  wenger
#  Check_jspop now re-tries check_connect once if the first
#  one fails, just in case we're generating some restarts when
#  we don't really need to; fixed bug that run_check emails
#  had the wrong subject line if -dev was specified.
#
#  Revision 1.27.8.2.10.1  2004/06/30 18:32:07  wenger
