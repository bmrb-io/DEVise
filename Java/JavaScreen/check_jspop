#  Revision 1.2  1999/06/30 18:23:10  wenger
#  check_jspop now causes jspop to run two deviseds; jspop script sleeps
#  after launching Xvfb.
#
#  Revision 1.1  1999/06/17 18:55:27  wenger
#  Fixed kill_devised2 script for problems with 'ps'; added check_jspop
#  script for restarting jspop if necessary.
