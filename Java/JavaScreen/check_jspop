#  Revision 1.14  2000/12/06 21:42:58  wenger
#  Added ID string to .out files to avoid conflicts.
#
#  Revision 1.13  2000/12/06 19:52:10  wenger
#  Check scripts now have 'test' ID option, use new kill scripts; check_jss
#  starts 4 deviseds (for BMRB).
#
#  Revision 1.12  2000/05/02 18:27:43  wenger
#  Set up restart scripts for BMRB setup on yola/aden.
#
#  Revision 1.11  2000/04/17 20:15:49  wenger
#  Fixed up architecture check.
#
#  Revision 1.10  2000/04/17 20:01:15  wenger
#  Modified DEVise.kill, check_jspop, and run_check so that they work
#  on Linux as well as Solaris; changed pid-finding code in them to be
#  more reliable.
#
#  Revision 1.9  2000/02/18 22:21:16  wenger
#  Various changes to make cron scripts work better with new two-machine
#  setup: added -id argument to devise, jspop, jss; updated cron scripts
#  that check status of jspop, etc.; improved usage messages of jspop,
#  jss, js; improved DEVise.kill script; removed obsolete sections of
#  Java code.
#
#  Revision 1.8  1999/12/17 23:24:10  wenger
#  Improved scripts to automatically re-start jspops if necessary.
#
#  Revision 1.7  1999/12/10 20:15:21  wenger
#  Improved scripts now check separately for "regular" and "soil science"
#  jspop and deviseds.
#
#  Revision 1.6  1999/07/23 15:06:35  wenger
#  Okay, finally got args passed to jspop correctly.
#
#  Revision 1.5  1999/07/22 21:29:15  wenger
#  Typo in previous commit.
#
#  Revision 1.4  1999/07/22 21:25:01  wenger
#  Fixed problem with passing args to jspop.
#
#  Revision 1.3  1999/07/01 14:48:17  wenger
#  Added sleep after killing jspop and Xvfb to fix problem with the new Xvfb
#  sometimes starting before the old one is done being killed.
#
#  Revision 1.2  1999/06/30 18:23:10  wenger
#  check_jspop now causes jspop to run two deviseds; jspop script sleeps
#  after launching Xvfb.
#
#  Revision 1.1  1999/06/17 18:55:27  wenger
#  Fixed kill_devised2 script for problems with 'ps'; added check_jspop
#  script for restarting jspop if necessary.
