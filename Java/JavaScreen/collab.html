<TITLE>DEVise JavaScreen Collaboration</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<body background="logo_background.gif">

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The DEVise JavaScreen collaboration feature allows users to work together
interactively, even if they are widely separated geographically.

<p>The essence of JavaScreen collaboration is as follows: one user is the
"leader", and the other users are "followers".  The leader interacts
normally with their JavaScreen applet; whatever actions they perform
are mirrored by the followers' applets.  For example, if the leader
moves a cursor, the same cursor will be moved in the followers' applets,
and the results of that movement will be the same.

<p>While in collaboration mode, the followers' JavaScreen applets do not
accept most user input (cursor moves, for example).

<h3>Starting Collaboration</h3>

<p>Starting collaboration is a two-part process: first, the leader JavaScreen
must create a collaboration; second, the follower or followers must connect
to that collaboration.

<h4>Leader</h4>

<p>At the present time, the leader must have a session open to successfully
allow collaboration.  To enable collaboration once a session is open,
perform the following procedure:
<ul>
<li>Click the "Collaborate" button.
<li>Then click the "Become Leader" button within the dialog.
<li>When you click the "Become Leader" button, a new dialog will
be shown in which you can set a collaboration name and password.  The
collaboration name is simply a way of identifying the collaboration to
prospective followers.  If you don't want third parties "eavesdropping"
on your collaboration, you should set a password for your collaboration.
</ul>

<h4>Followers</h4>

<p>Follow the link to get a <a target="_blank" href="collabf.html">
JavaScreen follower</a>.

<p>Once the leader has created a collaboration, the followers can connect to
that leader and start the actual collaboration.  To do so, perform this
procedure:

<ul>
<li>Click the "Collaborate" button in the follower JavaScreen.
<li>Then click the "Become Follower" button in the dialog.
<li>A new dialog will be shown with a list of available collaboration leaders.
For each leader, its client ID, collaboration name, host name, and session
name are shown.  Select the appropriate leader in the dialog, and click "OK".
<li>A new dialog will be shown in which you must enter the collaboration
password.  If you enter the correct password, you will become a
collaboration follower. 
</ul>

<h3>Stopping Collaboration</h3>

<h4>Leader</h4>

<p>The leader can end the collaboration as follows:
<ul>
<li>Click the "Collaborate" button.
<li>Click the "Quit Leader" button.
</ul>

<p>The leader can also end the collaboration by simply exiting.  In
either of these cases, the followers will all return to their pre-
collaboration state.

<h4>Followers</h4>

Any follower can exit from collaboration mode as follows:
<ul>
<li>Click the "Collaborate" button.
<li>Then click the "Quit Following" button in the dialog.
</ul>
This will return the follower to its pre-collaboration state.

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>At the present time, collaboration does not work in CGI communication mode.
(CGI mode is a special mode to deal with the problem of firewalls that prevent
the JavaScreen client from connecting a socket back to the JSPoP on the
web server machine.  You can tell that you're in CGI mode because the
text just to the right of the JavaScreen buttons says 'CGI' instead of
'Socket'.)

<p>At the present time, you must exit and restart the collaboration to
switch leaders.
