<TITLE>DEVise JavaScreen Collaboration</TITLE>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The DEVise JavaScreen collaboration feature allows users to work together
interactively, even if they are widely separated geographically.

<p>The essence of JavaScreen collaboration is as follows: one user is the
"leader", and the other users are "followers".  The leader interacts
normally with their JavaScreen applet; whatever actions they perform
are mirrored by the followers' applets.  For example, if the leader
moves a cursor, the same cursor will be moved in the followers' applets,
and the results of that movement will be the same.

<p>While in collaboration mode, the followers' JavaScreen applets do not
accept most user input (cursor moves, for example).

<h3>Starting Collaboration</h3>

<p>Starting collaboration is a two-part process: first, the leader JavaScreen
must enable collaboration; second, the follower or followers must start
collaboration.

<h4>Leader</h4>

<p>At the present time, the leader must have a session open to successfully
allow collaboration.  To enable collaboration once a session is open,
perform the following procedure:
<ul>
<li>Click the "Collaborate" button.
<li>Then click the "Enable Collaboration" button within the dialog.
<li>When you click the "Enable Collaboration" button, a new dialog will
be shown in which you can set a collaboration password.  If you don't want
third parties "eavesdropping" on your collaboration, you should change the
password to something other than the default.
</ul>

<h4>Followers</h4>

<p>Once the leader has enabled collaboration, the followers can connect to
that leader and start the actual collaboration.  To do so, perform this
procedure:

<ul>
<li>Click the "Collaborate" button in the follower JavaScreen.
<li>Then click the "Start Collaboration" button in the dialog.
<li>A new dialog will be show with a list of available collaboration leaders.
For each leader, its client ID, host name, and session name are shown.
Select the appropriate leader in the dialog, and click "OK".
<li>A new dialog will be shown in which you must enter the collaboration
password.  If you enter the correct password, you will become a
collaboration follower. 
</ul>

<h3>Stopping Collaboration</h3>

<h4>Leader</h4>

<p>The leader can end the collaboration as follows:
<ul>
<li>Click the "Collaborate" button.
<li>Click the "Disable Collaboration" button.
</ul>

<p>The leader can also end the collaboration by simply exiting.  In
either of these cases, the followers will all return to their pre-
collaboration state.

<h4>Followers</h4>

Any follower can exit from collaboration mode as follows:
<ul>
<li>Click the "Collaborate" button.
<li>Then click the "Finish Collaboration" button in the dialog.
</ul>
This will return you to your pre-collaboration state.

any follower can quit
leader can disable or quit

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>At the present time, collaboration does not work in CGI communication mode.

<p>At the present time, you must exit and restart the collaboration to
switch leaders.
