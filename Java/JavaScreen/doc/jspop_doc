* Overall purpose:

The JSPoP (JavaScreen Point of Presence) acts as a multiplexer between
JavaScreens and deviseds.  When there are fewer deviseds than JSAs,
the JSPoP gives each JSA (and its user) the impression that it has a
dedicated devised by connecting the JSA to a devised when it requests
a service, and breaking the connection when necessary to service another
JSA.  (The devised's state associated with a particular JSA is saved
and restored as needed.)

This functionality is needed partly because a devised can only support
one client at a time.  Furthermore, allowing one JSPoP to have multiple
deviseds running on different machines allows us to spread the processing
load over several machines, not just the web server.


* Startup:

At startup, the JSPoP waits for connections from JSAs and JSSs.  It doesn't
really do anything until there's a connection from one or the other.
When a JSS connects to the JSPoP, the JSPoP creates a DEViseServer object
for each devised started by that JSS.  When a JSA connects to the JSPoP,
the JSPoP checks that the JSA is not at a prohibited IP address, and
possibly does some other legality checks.  The JSPoP sends a unique ID
back to the JSA.  [Note: we need more details on how this ID is used.]

[Note: I'm not sure what happens if a JSA connects and no deviseds are
running.]


* Overall organization

There are four main components of the JSPoP:
- The JSS handler.
- The DEViseServer objects.
- The scheduler.
- Logging and checkpointing.


* Threads:

The following threads exist in the JSPoP:
- One for the JSS handler.
- One for each DEViseServer object.
- One for the scheduler.
- One for logging and checkpointing.


* Ports:

[See DEViseGlobals for port numbers.]


* Main operation:

The JSPoP receives commands from the JavaScreen; in a few cases it is able
to reply to the command itself, but in most cases it simply forwards the
command to a devised.

Note that when the JSPoP receives a command from the JavaScreen, it
immediately acknowledges the command.  The JavaScreen changes the background
of the revolving gears from white to blue when it receives the acknowledgement.

The JSPoP maintains a list of JavaScreens and a list of DEViseServers;
the list of JavaScreens is broken into those that are running and those
that are waiting (have a pending command and are not connected to a
DEViseServer).  Each time the scheduler runs, it checks for JSAs on
the waiting list, and removes one from the running list if necessary.
In order to guarantee forward progress, a JSA is never removed from the
running list until at least one command has completed.  (Hongyu
suggests that we might want to add a command-line argument for the
time interval at which the scheduler runs.)

The JSPoP DEViseServer class detects a devised crashing or hanging in two
ways:
- By timing out since the last command from the devised.
- By receiving a message it cannot understand.
When either of these cases happen, the DEViseServer requests that the
JSS kill the devised and start a new one.
