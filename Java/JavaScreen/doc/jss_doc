* Overall purpose:

The JSS (JavaScreen Server) launches and kills deviseds on command from
the JSPoP.

The functionality of the JSS was originally incorporated into the JSPoP,
but was moved to a separate process so that the JSPoP and deviseds can
run on separate machines.


* Startup:

When a JSS starts, it first attempts to start one or more deviseds (the
number is specified as a command-line argument).  It then attempts to
connect to a JSPoP.  If it is unable to connect to a JSPoP, it kills
its deviseds and then exits.


* Threads:

Each JSS has only a single thread.


* Ports:

[See DEViseGlobals for port numbers.]


* Main operation:

The JSS does not detect when a devised crashes or hangs.  This is done
by the JSPoP.


* Other:
