* Overall purpose:

* Startup:

* Threads:

The JavaScreen has two threads:
- The default thread, which does the drawing.
- The command handling thread (see DEViseCmdDispatcher).


* Ports:

[See DEViseGlobals for port numbers.]


* Main operation:

* Other:

When the command dispatcher gets a command that requires changing a
canvas, it first sends the command to the DEViseServer object (which
may do some processing), which then sends the request to the DEViseCanvas
object.  The change requests are queued up, and Hongyu says that there
may be problems if more than one request is in the queue at a time.
(This is a problem only for the applet version of the JavaScreen, not
the stand-alone version.)  Hongyu says that JDK 1.2 will allow us to
fix this problem.  The result of the problem is that the image that
ends up in a canvas may not be correct (for example, cursors not correctly
XOR'ing text drawn by the JavaScreen).
