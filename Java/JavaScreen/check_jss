#
#  Revision 1.6  2001/01/22 17:08:13  wenger
#  Added DEViseCheckPop to actually connect to the jspop when checking
#  with cron; added JAVAC_CheckPop command to make this possible; cleaned
#  up some of the jspop code dealing with heartbeats, etc.; DEViseCommSocket
#  constructor error messages now go to stderr.
#
#  Revision 1.5  2001/01/08 20:31:55  wenger
#  Merged all changes thru mgd_thru_dup_gds_fix on the js_cgi_br branch

#  Merged chagnes from link_gui_improvements thru js_restart_improvements
#  onto the branch, removing imgport code from the restart scripts.
#
#  Revision 1.4  2000/12/08 20:55:02  wenger
#  Major changes to cron job scripts to check and restart jspop, etc., so they
#  work when jspop and jss are on different machines.
#
#  Revision 1.3  2000/12/06 21:42:59  wenger
#  Added ID string to .out files to avoid conflicts.
#
#  Revision 1.2  2000/12/06 19:52:10  wenger
#  Check scripts now have 'test' ID option, use new kill scripts; check_jss
#  starts 4 deviseds (for BMRB).
#
#  Revision 1.1.4.1  2000/11/15 16:11:02  wenger
#  Improved DEVise.kill, check* and run* scripts: added alternate path lines
#  for perl and csh; added 'test' id, other cleanups; added scripts to run
#  the JS with soil and test ports.
#
#  Revision 1.1  2000/05/02 18:27:52  wenger
