#  Revision 1.10.8.1  2005/11/15 17:13:58  wenger
#  A bunch of changes to improve restart logging, etc.:
#  - Better error messages in jss.java.
#  - Set maximum memory for all production Java server processes to
#    256 MB (because of weird problems on marlin.bmrb.wisc.edu).
#  - DEVise.jspop and DEVise.jspop.loc send all start_devised output to
#    a log file instead of to /dev/null.
#  - check_jspop now puts check_connect.err.* in logs and doesn't
#    delete it when there's an error.
#  - run_check puts *starting* timestamp at beginning of output, saves
#    output from failed tests to logs.
#  - start_devised generates more output, now that it's being saved.
#  - Better error messages from check_jsall, check_jspop, and check_jss.
#
#  Revision 1.10  2001/07/20 18:04:15  wenger
#  Added hostname to pid files.
#
#  Revision 1.9  2001/06/08 17:38:01  wenger

#
#  Revision 1.6  2001/01/22 17:08:13  wenger
#  Added DEViseCheckPop to actually connect to the jspop when checking
#  with cron; added JAVAC_CheckPop command to make this possible; cleaned
#  up some of the jspop code dealing with heartbeats, etc.; DEViseCommSocket
#  constructor error messages now go to stderr.
#
#  Revision 1.5  2001/01/08 20:31:55  wenger

#
#  Revision 1.4  2000/12/08 20:55:02  wenger
#  Major changes to cron job scripts to check and restart jspop, etc., so they
#  work when jspop and jss are on different machines.
#
#  Revision 1.3  2000/12/06 21:42:59  wenger
#  Added ID string to .out files to avoid conflicts.
#
#  Revision 1.2  2000/12/06 19:52:10  wenger
#  Check scripts now have 'test' ID option, use new kill scripts; check_jss
#  starts 4 deviseds (for BMRB).

#  the JS with soil and test ports.
#
#  Revision 1.1  2000/05/02 18:27:52  wenger
