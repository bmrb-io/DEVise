#  Revision 1.8.8.2  2004/01/25 23:35:49  wenger
#  JavaScreen kill scripts kill things with SIGKILL after trying
#  a "softer" kill (because of problems on RedHat 9 with processes
#  refusing to be killed).
#
#  Revision 1.8.8.1  2003/06/18 18:06:54  wenger
#  There is now a configuration option to kill Xvfb when killing the
#  JSS (to deal with the problem that once in a while Xvfb gets itself
#  goofed up and you cannot successfully restart the DEViseds unless you
#  kill Xvfb first).
#
#  Revision 1.8  2001/07/20 18:04:15  wenger
#  Added hostname to pid files.
#
#  Revision 1.7  2001/06/08 16:49:18  wenger
#  Can't use wait the way I was trying to.
#
#  Revision 1.6  2001/06/08 15:52:20  wenger
#  Implemented non-ps-based JSPoP/JSS/DEVised checking.
#
#  Revision 1.5  2001/05/11 20:36:16  wenger
#  Set up a package for the JavaScreen code.
#
#  Revision 1.4  2001/01/08 20:31:59  wenger
#  Merged all changes thru mgd_thru_dup_gds_fix on the js_cgi_br branch
#  back onto the trunk.
#
#  Revision 1.1.4.3  2001/01/05 20:49:40  wenger
#  Merged changes from zero_js_cache_check thru dup_gds_fix from the trunk
#  onto the js_cgi_br branch.
#
#  Revision 1.3  2000/12/27 20:34:03  wenger
#  A few more jspop-script fixes; the JavaScreen devised now gets
#  composite.ini from its own lib directory.
#
#  Revision 1.1.4.2  2000/12/27 19:38:37  wenger
#  Merged changes from js_restart_improvements thru zero_js_cache_check from
#  the trunk onto the js_cgi_br branch.
#
#  Revision 1.2  2000/12/13 22:02:04  wenger
#  Added more paths to perl.
#
#  Revision 1.1.4.1  2000/12/11 23:09:54  wenger
#  Re-adding stuff that somehow got goofed up in the merge.
#
#  Revision 1.1.2.1  2000/12/11 22:22:42  wenger
#  Merged chagnes from link_gui_improvements thru js_restart_improvements
#  onto the branch, removing imgport code from the restart scripts.
#
#  Revision 1.1  2000/12/06 19:49:07  wenger
#  New scripts to kill jspop and jss.
