#  Changed JavaScreen scripts from sh to bash because of problems

#  Merged V1_7b0_br_4 thru V1_7b0_br_5 to trunk.  (This should
#  be the end of the V1_7b0_br branch.)

#  There is now a configuration option to kill Xvfb when killing the
#  JSS (to deal with the problem that once in a while Xvfb gets itself
#  goofed up and you cannot successfully restart the DEViseds unless you
#  kill Xvfb first).
