#  Changed JavaScreen scripts from sh to bash because of problems
#  at Osaka -- their sh didn't accept the -e test.
#
#  Revision 1.2  2005/12/06 20:00:43  wenger
#  Merged V1_7b0_br_4 thru V1_7b0_br_5 to trunk.  (This should
#  be the end of the V1_7b0_br branch.)

#  Revision 1.1.2.2  2004/01/25 23:35:57  wenger
#  JavaScreen kill scripts kill things with SIGKILL after trying
#  a "softer" kill (because of problems on RedHat 9 with processes
#  refusing to be killed).
#
#  Revision 1.1.2.1  2003/06/18 18:07:04  wenger
#  There is now a configuration option to kill Xvfb when killing the
#  JSS (to deal with the problem that once in a while Xvfb gets itself
#  goofed up and you cannot successfully restart the DEViseds unless you
#  kill Xvfb first).
