<h2>Heteronuclear NOE</h2>

<p>
The <em>nuclear Overhauser enhancement </em> or
<em>nuclear Overhauser effect</em> is the fractional change
in intensity of one NMR line when another resonance is irradiated
in a <em>double irradiation experiment</em>.  Nuclear Overhauser Effects
are due to <em>dipolar interactions</em> (through space) between different
nuclei and are correlated with the inverse sixth power of the
internuclear distance.  Nuclear Overhauser effects are customarily
quoted in percent of the unperturbed resonance intensity.
