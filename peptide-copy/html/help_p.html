<h2>Percent Assigned Atoms</h2>

<p>In these plots, for each residue in the molecule, the percent of the total
number of atoms (H, C, and N) that have reported chemical shift assignments in
the entry is given.  All C and N atoms found in the standard 20 amino acids
have been included.  For H, the carboxylic acid protons on ASP and GLU and the
amino protons on LYS have not been included in the total possible atoms, but
the hydroxyl protons of SER, THR, and TYR have been included.  The three
protons in a methyl group are counted as one for these calculations.
