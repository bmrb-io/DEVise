<h2>Hydrogen Exchange</h2>

<p>
The top graph displays the log of the hydrogen exchange rates.
</p>

<p>
The bottom graph displays the log of the measured protection factors.
Positive gray bars indicate that the exchange was too slow to detect
over a 14 day period, while negative gray bars indicate residues for
which complete exchange occurred during the dead time of the
experiment (~30 min).
</p>

<!-- Uncertainty values are taken from the least-squares 
   fit. Exchange rates of 1.00E-09 were too slow to fit
   an accurate decay curve with data acquired over the
   course of the expt (14 days), and thus have no 
   associated uncertainty.
