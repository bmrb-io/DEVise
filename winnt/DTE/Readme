To Install DTE for Winnt :

	Install native drivers of database (e.g. SQLNET for Oracle). For Oracle, after installing the native drivers, you can copy the listener.ora and tnsnames.ora files to NT's /oracle/network/admin directory. Execute the SQLPlus program, enter the following
		User name : scott
		Password  : tiger
		Host String : devise_oracle
	If you can connect by this, Oracle is working. 
	Install the proper ODBC Driver. 
	Then create the project directory as :
		"C:\Program Files\DevStudio\MyProjects\DTE"
	Copy the "djtypes.h" , "unistd.h" files in this directory.
	Create a directory named "windows" in this directory and put the config.h file there. 
	Execute Visual C++, Click File menu, choose Open Workspace and select DTE Workspace which is in 	P:\devise\your_user\winnt\DTE (Donko, yours may be in P:\coral\...)
	Click Project menu, choose Settings. In this window, select the C/C++ tab and adjust the Include directories (that are indicated by /I "....." in the Project Options part) to point your devise directory.
	Compile the project.
