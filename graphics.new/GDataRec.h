  Revision 1.13.14.1  2002/09/05 19:14:03  wenger
  Implemented GData attribute value links (but not GUI for creating
  them).

  Revision 1.13  1999/08/10 20:15:05  wenger
  Parent views can now control the titles of view symbols.

  Revision 1.12  1999/07/13 17:32:42  wenger
  Parent view can now control attribute(s) in child view's mapping;
  cleaned up some of the mapping-related code; better command logging.

  Revision 1.11  1999/06/30 17:38:47  wenger
  Data color of parent view's mapping (if specified) now controls the
  background color of view symbols; defined constant strings for GData
  attribute values to avoid potential problems.

  Revision 1.10  1999/05/26 19:50:49  wenger
  Added bounding box info to GData, so that the selection of records by the
  visual filter is more accurate.  (Note that at this time the bounding box
  info does not take into account symbol orientation; symbol alignment is
  taken into account somewhat crudely.) This includes considerable
  reorganization of the mapping-related classes.  Fixed problem with
  pixelSize getting used twice in Rect shape (resulted in size being the
  square of pixel size).

  Revision 1.9  1999/05/21 14:52:28  wenger
  Cleaned up GData-related code in preparation for including bounding box
  info.

  Revision 1.8  1998/01/30 21:53:14  wenger
  Did some cleaning up of the MappingInterp and NativeExpr code
  (NativeExpr still needs a lot more); NativeExpr code can now
  parse expressions containing constant strings (they are treated
  as numerical zero for now) (this fixes bug 275).

  Revision 1.7  1997/11/24 23:14:51  weaver
  Changes for the new ColorManager.

  Revision 1.6.10.1  1997/05/21 20:40:26  weaver
  Changes for new ColorManager

  Revision 1.6  1996/11/13 16:57:03  wenger
  Color working in direct PostScript output (which is now enabled);
  improved ColorMgr so that it doesn't allocate duplicates of colors
  it already has, also keeps RGB values of the colors it has allocated;
  changed Color to GlobalColor, LocalColor to make the distinction
  explicit between local and global colors (_not_ interchangeable);
  fixed global vs. local color conflict in View class; changed 'dali'
  references in command-line arguments to 'tasvir' (internally, the
  code still mostly refers to Dali).

  Revision 1.5  1996/07/18 20:31:54  jussi
  Renamed fields in structure to make sure no source file
  really uses these fields.

  Revision 1.4  1996/01/13 23:10:32  jussi
  Added support for Z attribute and shape attribute 2.

  Revision 1.3  1995/11/28 00:05:28  jussi
  Added copyright notice and cleaned up the code a bit.

  Revision 1.2  1995/09/05 22:14:55  jussi
  Added CVS header.
