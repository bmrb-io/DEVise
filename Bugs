			source files. (rkw)

010 05/31/96	OPEN	In TDataMap.c, call to ConvertToGData with _tmpPtr
			as argument may not be work correctly (alignment of
			_tmpPtr). (rkw)
			Deferred

			is all zeros -- sometimes crashes. (rkw)

012 06/06/96	OPEN	All TData's ever used in a session get saved, even
			if they're no longer used. (rkw)
			Deferred

013 07/10/96	FIXED	Schema editing code doesn't seem to recognize comment
			lines in the schema files -- tries to interpret them
			as attributes. (rkw)

014 07/11/96	FIXED   Schema editor doesn't allow entry of string lengths
			(always forces them to 10). (rkw) (duplicate of 004)

			datasources are open. (kb)

023 08/04/96	OPEN	Doing an extreme zoom in causes extra records to 
			suddenly appear. (kb)
			9/6/96: cause of problem found:
			Overflow problem when converting from devise
			coordinates (double) to X coordinates (short).
			See XWindowRep::FillRectArray for one possible
			solution which works for rectangles, but it won't
			quite right work for other types (eg lines).
			Deferred

024 08/06/96	OPEN	Zooming as far as you can in or out can cause 
			DEVise to fail an assertion. (kb)
			Deferred

025 08/07/96	OPEN	Keypad '5' doesn't work when num lock is off. (rkw)
			Deferred

026 08/07/96	OPEN	On HP and SPARC/SunOS, keypad keys only work when

			views aren't redrawn until you click in that window.
			(rkw)

033 08/23/96	FIXED	Run LandsEnd/test.tk -- one view doesn't draw
			correctly (because of links). (ssl/rkw)

034 08/28/96	FIXED	Run Dali1.tk without specifying Dali server ->
			core dump. (kb/rkw)

035 08/29/96	OPEN	Files in temp and work directories don't get
			cleaned up. (ssl/rkw)
			(Actually, the temp directory gets cleaned up if
			Devise exits normally.) (rkw 8/30/96)
			Deferred

036 08/30/96	FIXED	Run LandsEnd/a2.tk session with client/server
			Devise -> crashes (assertion fails in View.c). (rkw)

040 09/13/96	OPEN	+/- keys seem to only work on one view of piled/
			stacked views (see LandsEnd/a2.tk). (rkw)
			Deferred

041 09/16/96	OPEN	If you change the X mapping between a date attribute
			and an attribute of another type, the axis labels
			aren't correctly updated until the session is saved
			and re-opened. (rkw)
			Deferred

042 09/19/96	FIXED	Devise doesn't complain if you give an illegal
			command line option. (rkw)

043 09/24/96	FIXED	XWindowRep, PSWindowRep don't always check that they
			aren't overflowing points, rectAngles arrays. (rkw)

044 09/25/96	FIXED	GDataBin objects take way too much memory (256K
			for Connectors). (rkw)

045 10/07/96	FIXED   User can't enter a tab for a separator in the
			schema editing window. (rkw)

046 10/07/96	WORK	Create a window with the same name as a data stream
			-> crash. (rkw)  (This is a consequence of bug 016.)
			(Workaround implemented: ClassDir exits if a duplicate
			name is added. rkw 10/15/96)

047 10/08/96	FIXED	Load /p/devise/wenger/session/hourstats.tk, iconify
			the window -> crash. (rkw)

048 10/09/96	FIXED	Devise core dumps if data file named in catalog
			does not exist. (rkw)

049 10/11/96	OPEN	Load MailOrder/a2_full.tk session -- DEVISE_TMP
			directory gets huge amounts of stuff written to it.
			(Running with '-convert 0' flag prevents this.) (rkw)
			(Also, DEVise eventually crashes if the partition
			gets filled up.)
			Deferred

050 10/14/96	FIXED	Setting a GData attribute to recid does not work
			correctly (if it's already set it's okay, but
			setting it doesn't work). (rkw)

051 10/15/96    FIXED	Showing statistics as text produces many errors. (rkw)

052 10/16/96	FIXED	When importing a data stream (particularly when
			mapping recId to X) xlow sometimes comes up
			greater than xhigh. (rkw)

053 10/21/96	OPEN	You run out of available file descriptors if you
			have too many GDatas. (rkw)
			(Workaround: doesn't open GData files if '-convert 0'
			is specified on the command line.)
			Deferred

054 10/22/96    FIXED   Tcl error when defining visualization on a data
                        file that has one record. Reason: incr does not
                        work on floating-point numbers. (jpm)

055 10/22/96	FIXED	You can't find the name (not title) of a view from
			the GUI. (rkw)

056 10/24/96	OPEN	Too hard to hit the middle of boxes to display
			record data. (rkw)
			Deferred

057 10/24/96	CD	When you switch the layout of a window (e.g., vertical
			to horizontal) the window often is not redrawn. (rkw)

058 10/29/96	FIXED	Changing line width doesn't work in direct PostScript.
			(rkw)

059 11/05/96	OPEN	Keyboard callback function for SGI version of client/
			server library doesn't work. (rkw/na)
			Deferred

060 11/05/96	OPEN	WinServer's HandleButton(..) callback routine
			in client/server library can't handle continuous
			calls (holding down mouse button). (rkw/na)
			Deferred

061 11/11/96    FIXED   GData is never cached in memory! Found bug in
                        TData.h: int RecSize() somehow no longer virtual
                        as it should be. (jpm)

062 11/08/96	FIXED	Don't ask whether you want to close a session when
			there is no session open (e.g., immediately after
			starting devise). (ml/rkw)

063 11/12/96	WORK	Devise core dumps when trying to parse a schema
			with a string attribute that's missing the length.
			(rkw)
			(Workaround: assertion fails.)

064 11/14/96	FIXED	Load session test/miron_new.tk; pile the views in
			DEViseWn1, and flip the pile -> the view is drawn
			only when one of the three views is on top. (ml/
			rkw)

065 11/14/96	CD  	Load session test/dcb1.tk; the data in the 'Log
			Display' window is not drawn, even though a point
			query indicates that the data is there. (rkw/kb)

066 11/14/96	CD	Load session test/dbc1.tk; decrease the size of
			the symbols in the 'RunTime vs. ExecTime' view
			with the '-' key -> symbols change to single pixels
			much too soon. (rkw)

067 11/14/96	CD	Load session test/DBC.tk; in view 'Restarts vs.
			ExecTime', the whole view within the axes is filled
			in with a kind of maroon color. Problem does
                        not seem to exist any longer. (rkw/jpm)

068 11/14/96	FIXED	Exporting a session with data doesn't seem to work
			if there is more than one data source (export
			appears to work, but subsequent open fails).  (See
			session test/miron_new_wdata.tk.) (rkw)

069 11/14/96	OPEN	Load session test/dbc2.tk; most views are initially
			drawn with incorrect colors.  This somehow fixes
			itself if you force a redraw (resize windows, etc.).
			Problem does not seem to exist any longer.  Perhaps
			the saved pixmaps just got goofed up. (rkw/jpm)

070 11/14/96	CD/NB?	Load session test/dbc2.tk; toggling axes does not
			work correctly. Problem does not seem to exist
                        any longer. Perhaps this was not really a problem
                        in the first place? (jpm)
			(See also bug 110.)

071 11/18/96	FIXED	In piled views with axes, the data from non-"top"
			views sometimes overdraws the X axis and is drawn
			to the left of the Y axis. (rkw/jpm)
			(See also bug 098.)

072 11/19/96	FIXED	(With multi) Open test/multidemo2.tk, close it ->
			core dump (at least on HP and SPARC/Solaris). (rkw)

073 11/19/96	FIXED	Hit connector key ('c') on a scatter plot ->
			internal error. (ml/rkw)

074 11/19/96	FIXED	Data in view shouldn't be redrawn when you change
			the view title. (ml/rkw)

075 11/19/96	FIXED	If there's no view title, the Y axis (if any) is
			not displayed correctly. (rkw)

076 11/20/96	OPEN	'Child windows should have been destroyed first' error
			message (don't know exactly how to reproduce this).
			(rr/rkw)
			Deferred

077 11/21/96	OPEN	Importing data into a window with piled views
			doesn't work correctly -- new view gets put into
			window but is not visible unless views are unpiled.
			(rkw)

078 11/21/96	FIXED	Open a template as a session, cancel out of selecting
			a data stream -> some of the (internal) objects for
			the session are not destroyed (opening the same
			session again causes duplicate name error). (rkw)

079 11/21/96	OPEN	Data shouldn't be erased when switching from display
			to layout mode. (ml/rkw)
			Deferred

080 11/21/96	OPEN	'Working' should be shown while drilling down as
			the result of a middle button click. (ml/rkw)
			Deferred

081 11/22/96	FIXED	Derived data histograms not always working (see
			the session test/sales1.tk, must be on tiger to
			use this). (ml/rkw)
			(Histograms not supported on scatter plots yet.)

082 11/25/96	FIXED	Load session test/a2.tk -> core dump. (rkw/jpm)

083 11/25/96	FIXED	Printing directly to a printer doesn't work. (rkw)

084 11/25/96	FIXED	Temporary print file isn't removed after printing.
			(rkw)

085 11/26/96	FIXED	Record links to window with map not working right in
			session test/a2.tk (_all_ records are initially
			drawn; then if you force a redraw, only the correct
			ones are drawn). (rkw)

086 11/27/96	CD	Can't print session wenger/session/PrintTest6.tk
			(never finishes). (rkw)

087 12/02/96	FIXED	Removing a view causes DEVise to exit. (rkw)

088 12/02/96	FIXED	If you click on a view to select it while data is
			being drawn, the XOR'ing of the selection box gets
			goofed up. (ssl/rkw)

089 12/03/96	FIXED	PostScript bounding box does not fit tightly around
			the image. (ml/rkw)

090 12/03/96	FIXED	Load session test/MM1System.tk, print to PostScript;
			'Pwi' text comes out at wrong place. (ml/rkw)

091 12/03/96	FIXED	Print all windows to PostScript with more than one
			window -> core dump. (ml/rkw)

092 12/04/96	CD	Load session test/MM1System.tk -> lowest label on
			Y axis is a very small number instead of zero.
			Problem does not seem to exist any longer. (ml/rkw)

093 12/04/96	FIXED	Opening a statistics view from any other view causes
                        a core dump.  (Load session demo/colors.tk, and then
                        open the histogram view).  The believed cause is the
                        TData detects a change in the data and then cancels
                        all queries on it, but the QP still has a pointer
                        to the current qdata (which was deleted by the cancel)
                        and tries to continue processing the query.

094 12/06/96	FIXED	Linux version won't run because of an error in the
			shared memory code. (rkw)

095 12/16/96	FIXED	'OK' button in mapping editor doesn't work. (rkw)

096 12/16/96	CD	Can't display histograms at all -- you get 'invalid
			command name "findNumericCaseValue"' from Tcl/Tk.
			(rkw)

097 12/16/96	FIXED	'Duplicate window' should make an entirely separate
			copy of the window -- changing mappings, etc., in
			one window should not affect the other one. (ml/rkw)

098 12/16/96	FIXED	Load session test/molbio_demo.tk -> clip mask doesn't
			work on two of three piled views. (rkw/jpm)
			(This is a specific instance of bug 071.)

099 12/16/96	NB	Load session test/molbio_demo.tk -> zooming doesn't
			work correctly (sometimes zooms in X and Y when it
			should zoom only in X). (rkw)
                        Session didn't mark time attr as sorted, so the
                        system thought the view must be a scatter plot,
                        regardless of the symbol type (a line).
                        Perhaps this behavior should be modified. (kb)

100 12/16/96	OPEN	If you import data into several windows and specify
			that there should be an X link, _all_ views are
			linked to a single link; it would probably be better
			to have each window have its own X link. (ml/rkw)
			Deferred

101 12/16/96	OPEN	'5' key sometimes doesn't work correctly (for example,
			load the session test/bad5key.tk). (ml/rkw)
                        Cause: recIds don't have hi/lo values.
                        Technical cause: recIds don't have AttrInfo in
                        the TData, (ie, map->MapGAttr2TAttr(MappingCmd_X)
                        returns NULL when X is mapped to recId).
			Deferred

102 12/17/96	OPEN	Control-c doesn't seem to be able to terminate
			Devise if you have an input-grabbing Tk dialog
			open. (rkw)
			Deferred

103 12/20/96	FIXED	Bold, italic, and New Century Schoolbook fonts
			don't work in PostScript. (rkw)

104 12/23/96	FIXED	AttrProj::LastRecId should report an error when
			called on TData that doesn't have an index.  (rkw)

105 12/26/96	FIXED	Print a view with a non-white background to
			PostScript -> there are "stripes" where white shows
			through because the various background areas don't
			quite touch each other. (rkw)

106 12/30/96	FIXED	Load the session test/a2.tk; you get the following
			error: DEVise error: RangeList::Insert() recId 4,4
			already processed at
			../../graphics.new/RangeList.c: 219. (It doesn't
        		matter whether or not you're using shared memory.)
                        (rkw/jpm)

107 01/06/97	OPEN	If you have more than 19 views, those views are
			named 'View 110', 'View 111', etc., instead of
			'View 20', etc. (rkw)
			Deferred

108 01/09/97	FIXED	Load the session /p/devise/session/test/jussitape.tk,
			print to PostScript -> some of the text comes out at
			the wrong place. (jpm/rkw)

109 01/09/97	CD  	Load the session /p/devise/test/baa1.tk, select the
			view in window DEViseWn1, bring up the Query Tool ->
			the axis limits are not filled in. (rkw/kb)

110 01/09/97	NB	Load the session /p/devise/test/baa1.tk, select the
			view in window DEViseWn1 -> you can't display
			axes in this view. Not a bug: foreground color
                        was the same as background color, so axes just
                        weren't visible. (rkw/jpm)

111 01/10/97	OPEN	Got the following bug when loading the session
			/p/devise/session/demo/COD1.tk, only with shared
			memory, and only (but consistently) on the HP
			architecture: An internal error has occurred. The
			reason is: Inconsistent state
			(../../graphics.new/TDataAscii.c:824). (rkw)
			Deferred

112 01/10/97	FIXED	If a fatal error occurs while running with shared
			memory, you need to manually kill off processes
			to clean up. (rkw/jpm)

113 01/10/97	OPEN	Devise does not clean up shared memory resources
			if it crashes. (rkw)
			Deferred

114 01/10/97	FIXED	Load session /p/devise/session/test/baa1.tk, select
			view 'Location 1 Visits', print -> the data in the
			'BAA.am' view doesn't get printed.

115 01/13/97	OPEN    Load session test/molbio_demo.tk
                        XY zoom with mouse (button 3) produces what looks
                        like an X zoom and you must hit button '5' twice
                        to get the proper filter.
                        The cause is that the views are both X linked on
                        time and XY linked with the pile link.  To fix this
                        bug, the system needs to understand its links
                        better.  I think Shilpa's work should address this.
                        (kb)
			Deferred

116 01/13/97	FIXED	Load session /p/devise/session/test/birch.tk ->
			assertion fails indicating that points array
			in XWindowRep will overflow. (rkw)

117 01/14/97	OPEN	There are a number of places that variations on
			'records per batch' are independently defined to
			1024.  It looks like these must all be the same
			size and therefore should be defined in a single
			place. (rkw)
			Deferred

118 01/14/97	OPEN    Makefile couldn't find my.yacc.tab.h when making
			DEVise in dir like /p/devise/guangshu/test/solsparc
			(gc)
			Deferred

119 01/15/97	OPEN	If you have too many attributes, the 'Select X'
			menu in the 'Define Visualization' dialog goes
			off the bottom of the screen (ma/rkw)
			Deferred

120 01/15/97	OPEN	DTE/Makefile.base duplicates much of
			devread/Makefile.base. (rkw)
			Deferred

121 01/16/97	FIXED	Assertion 'color < Instance()->_numColors' in
			ColorMgr::GetColorRgb() failed when printing
			PostScript.  (Doesn't seem to be repeatable.) (rkw)

122 01/16/97	FIXED	Changing mapping (forcing data to be redrawn) goofs
			up the drawing of the view selection box. (rkw)
			(Setting FILL_WHOLE_BACKGROUND to 0 in View.c
			removed the fix for this bug.  rkw)

123 01/16/97	WORK	Load the sesson demo/COD1.tk; resize the 'Global
			View' window; then obscure any part of that window
			by raising another window -> the data area of the
			'Global View' window gets erased.  (Because the
			window is erroneously receiving an Expose event
			instead of the VisibilityNotify event it should
			be getting.) (rkw)
			Note: this bug shows up with fvwm but not with twm,
			tvtwm, or mwm.
			(Workaround in View::HandleExpose().)

124 01/17/97	FIXED	Drawing of the selection box gets goofed up if the
			actual data overdraws it. (rkw)

125 01/22/97	FIXED	When the help window is shown, the topics do not show
			up. (rkw)

126 01/22/97	FIXED	When views are unstacked, they're not always redrawn
			correctly. (rkw)

127 01/22/97	WORK	'Attributes' and 'Colors' buttons in Query Tool do
			nothing. (rkw)
			Workaround: removed the buttons.

128 01/22/97	OPEN	If you change both the X and Y values in the Query
			Tool on a view with X and Y links, only the X change
			takes effect. (rkw)
			Deferred

129 01/22/97	OPEN	Date attribute value displayed as a floating
			point number in Query dialog when filter changed
			with keypad zoom/pan keys. (jpm)
			Deferred
