			(Most of these have been fixed -- at least the big
			ones.  rkw 10/15/96)

002 05/14/96	FIXED	DEVise hogs an awful lot of CPU cycles even when
			you are not doing anything. (rkw/kb) (jpm)

003 05/14/96	FIXED	Numeric keypad keys don't always work correctly

005 05/16/96	OPEN	Physical schema editor does not support multi-word

			Jan 1 1970 (Unix zero time value). (jpm)

007 05/16/96	FIXED	Kiviat graph cannot be destroyed once created.

			window manager causes Devise to crash. (jpm)

009 05/22/96	FIXED	OBJ in generic/Makefile.base doesn't get the

			source files. (rkw)

010 05/31/96	OPEN	In TDataMap.c, call to ConvertToGData with _tmpPtr
			as argument may not be work correctly (alignment of

023 08/04/96	OPEN	Doing an extreme zoom in causes extra records to

			solution which works for rectangles, but it won't
			quite right work for other types (eg lines).

			core dump. (kb/rkw)

035 08/29/96	OPEN	Files in temp and work directories don't get
			cleaned up. (ssl/rkw)

			command line option. (rkw)

043 09/24/96	OPEN	XWindowRep, PSWindowRep don't always check that they

			for Connectors). (rkw)

046 10/07/96	OPEN	Create a window with the same name as a data stream
			-> crash. (rkw)  (This is a consequence of bug 016.)
