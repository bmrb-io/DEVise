ImRdoptCompress is a tcl interface to ImRdopt for
compressing as closely to a target size (or target bpp)
as possible. The script calls ImRdopt, so make sure
it is on your path.


Usage:
Pass the entire command-line as you would for ImRdopt.
ImRdoptCompress can accept some additional flags, which
are explained below:

--size
--bpp
     Specify what kind of target you want: size or bpp.
     Default is bpp, and the default target is 1.0 (see --target)

--target T
    Specify that you want target T (which is either a size in
    bytes or a bpp value, determined by --size or --bpp).
    Default is 1.0

--attempts N
    How many attempts to make to acheive the target.
    Default is 5.
    The program also terminates if it starts cycling.

--tolerance tol
--postolerance ptol
--negtolerance ntol
--bestabserr
    How much error you are willing to accept in achieving the
    target. Default is 0. You can set this to a higher value,
    and increase "attempts". --tolerance sets both positive
    and negative tolerance to tol. If the target cannot be achieved
    within the prescribed tolerance, by default, the best result
    *under* the target will be used. This behavior can be changed
    by specifying --bestabserr, in which case the the case that
    gave the best absolute error will be used.

--outfile fname
    The compressed file will be "fname".
    Default is cfile.jpg

--sequential
--progressive
    Determines sequential or progressive JPEG. Default is sequential.

Example
----------

If you have an image foo.ppm that you want to compress to a
sequntial JPEG file foo.jpg with size nearly 10000 bytes, you
might do:

ImRdoptCompress -coarse 4 -thresh 20 foo.ppm --size --target 10000 \
    --attempts 10 --tolerance 50 --outfile foo.jpg --sequential
