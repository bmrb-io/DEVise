To compile (on Pentium-Solaris), do:

make -f makefile.PENTIUM

Use the appropriate make.* file for your machine.
Each subdirectory also has a make.* file for each
architecture, along with instructions for modifications
for other architectures/machines.

To exclude RD-OPT from Tasvir, remove the flag
"-DHAVE_RDOPT" from the makefile in the Tasvir
directory.

To exclude SPIHT (wavelet compression by Said&Pearlman,
which is patented and copyrighted) remove the flag
"-DHAVE_SPIHT" from the makefile in the Tasvir
directory.
