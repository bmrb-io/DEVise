  Calling sequence
  ****************

Basic sequence that *must* be followed:

  Image *Im; 

  1. Either malloc or set Im to point to an Image structure.

  2. ImInitImg(Im, size);

  3. ImPeekImg(Im); 

  4. ImReadImg(Im);

  5. ImFreeImg(Im);

* No image routine can be called before ImInitImg, and after
  ImFreeImg (except for restarting with another ImInitImg).

* ImPrintImgChars can be called any time after ImPeekImg.

* ImSetKind can only be called  before ImPeekImg

* ImSetKindRaw can be only be called  before ImPeekImg

* ImSetSampleBits can be called anytime before ImReadImg. However,
  the image kind must be IM_RAW (either set by ImSetKind or
  ImSetKindRaw, or determined by ImPeekImg)

* ImSetImgFile, ImSetImgFd, ImSetImgBytes can be called
  any number of times between ImInitImg and ImFreeImg.

* ImReadMoreImg can be called any number of times after ImReadImg.
  Typically, you would reset the image source using
  ImSetImgFile, ImSetImgFd, ImSetImgBytes, and then call
  ImReadMoreImg.

* ImSaveImg can be called after ImReadImg

* ImSetImgDim, ImStretchAndShrink, ImBackToNormal, ImChangeCspace
  can be called after ImReadImg

* ImDiscardOrig can be called after ImPeekImg (by default, the
  original image will be saved in a temp file on changes).

* ImSetOrigCspace can be called after ImPeekImg but before
  ImReadImg
