        2) y minimum (low)
        4) line width

POLYLINE - arbitrary-shape polygon
    Attrs: Successive attrs describe X and Y offsets to the next
        point on the polygon, originating at the data point, i.e.
        (X, Y) to (X+Attr0, Y+Attr1) to (X+Attr0+Attr2,
        Y+Attr1+Attr3), etc.

IMAGE - graphic image imported from a file
    Attrs:
        0) filename or image
        1) image type (1=image file, send filename to
           Tasvir; 2=image file, send image to Tasvir; 3= image,
           send image to Tasvir)
        2) aspect ratio (0=don't maintain aspect ratio of images;
           1=maintain aspect ratio of images)

the specified rectangle
    Attrs:
        0) string
        1) format string (for numerical attributes only) (not
           required)
        2) width
        3) height
        4) whether to outline the rectangle
    Note: if width is < 0.0, it is ignored and the size of the text is
    determined only by the height (except that the text will be reduced if
    it doesn't fit within the view).

        0) string
        1) format string (for numerical attributes only) (not
           required)
    Note: size is normally in points; however, if it is <= 1.0, size is
    a fraction of the screen height.
