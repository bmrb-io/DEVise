        1) format string (for numerical attributes only) (not
           required)
        2) width

        4) whether to outline the rectangle
        5) alignment (-4 = northwest, -3 = west, -2 = southwest, -1 = north,

    determined only by the height (except that the text will be reduced if
    it doesn't fit within the view).  If orientation is non-zero, the text
    will be truncated instead of scaled if it doesn't fit the given size.

    Note: Z is maximum font size in points if it is > 1.

    a fraction of the printable window bounding box height.
