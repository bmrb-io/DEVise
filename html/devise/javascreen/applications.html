<h1>Molecular Biology Peptide</h1>

<br clear=left>
<p>This session shows a peptide structure and related
data.  The peptide structure shown in the main view can be scaled and rotated.
The cursor in the top right window is used to select which residues are
shown in the 3D view and the bottom views; the cursor in the bottom right
view is used to select which atoms are shown in the 3D view (backbone atoms,
side chain heavy atoms, and protons).

<p>The bottom left and bottom center views show the log of the H-exchange
protection factor and heteronuclear NOE, respectively, versus residue
sequence code.  The cursors in these two views select which residues are
highlighted (bright green) in the 3D view.  (The highlighted residues are
the intersection of the residues selected by the two cursors.)

<h1>Soil Science Weather Data</h1>

<h3>Automated Surface Observation Stations (ASOS)</h3>

<a href="http://biron.cs.wisc.edu/soil_sci/asos.html">
  <img src="asos.gif" align=left alt="ASOS session"></a>
<br clear=left>

<br clear=left>
<p>This session shows data from the ASOS network of weather stations
in Wisconsin and nearby states.  The main focus of the session is the
three large views in the center.  These views show three selected weather
variables for two selected stations.  The cursors in the large view in
the upper right are used to select the two stations; the cursors in the
three small views on the left select the variables to be shown.  The
bottom view shows the time range for which data is available, superimposed
on the theoretical solar radiation (showing the seasons).  The cursor
in this view selects the time range displayed in the main views.

<h3>Automated Weather Observation Network (AWON)</h3>

<a href="http://biron.cs.wisc.edu/soil_sci/awon_viewer.html">
  <img src="awon.gif" align=left alt="AWON session"></a>
<br clear=left>

<br clear=left>
<p>This session shows data from the AWON network of weather stations
in Wisconsin.  The main focus of the session is the
five large views in the center.  These views show five selected weather
variables for two selected stations.  The cursors in the view in
the upper right are used to select the two stations; the cursors in the
five small views on the left select the variables to be shown.  The
bottom view shows the time range for which data is available, superimposed
on the theoretical solar radiation (showing the seasons).  The cursor
in this view selects the time range displayed in the main views.

<h1>Mideast Maps</h1>

<a href="http://biron.cs.wisc.edu/maps.html">
  <img src="maps.gif" align=left alt="Mideast maps session"></a>
<br clear=left>

<br clear=left>
<p>This session shows various maps of middle eastern countries.  The
selected map is obviously shown in the left view.  The cursor in the large
view on the right is used to select which map is shown.  Each square in
that view indicates an available map.  To the left of this view is a list
of the countries for which maps are available; above it is a list of the
various types of maps (land use, population, etc.).  The view just above
the map lists which map is being shown; the selected map is also highlighted
in the list of countries and map types.

<h1>Mars Images</h1>

<a href="http://biron.cs.wisc.edu/mars.html">
  <img src="mars.gif" align=left alt="Mars images session"></a>
<br clear=left>

<br clear=left>
<p>This session shows images of Mars.  There are two sets of images: visible
light and pseudocolor for elevation.  The upper left and upper middle views
contain linked cursors that are used to select which images are shown in the
bottom views.  The view on the right shows the maximum versus the minimum
elevation for the area covered by each image.  The selected regions are
highlighted in yellow.
