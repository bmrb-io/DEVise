<h1>Molecular Biology Peptide</h1>

<a href="http://pumori.cs.wisc.edu/bmrb/4096_example.html">

<br clear=left>
<p>This session shows a peptide structure and related data.  The peptide
structure shown in the main view can be scaled and rotated.  The cursor
in the right view is used to select which residues are shown in the main
view (the selected residues are listed in the view just to the right of
the main view).  The view in the lower left corner is used to select
which parts of the structure (backbone, side chains, and hydrogens) are
shown in the main view.

<p>The view on the left lists the various chemical parameters that are
available for this peptide.  The cursor is used to select which parameter
is displayed in the bottom view.  The cursor in the bottom view selects
which residues are highlighted (green) in the main view.

<h1>Mideast Maps</h1>

<br clear=left>

<br clear=left>
<p>This session shows various maps of middle eastern countries.  The
selected map is obviously shown in the left view.  The cursor in the large
view on the right is used to select which map is shown.  Each square in
that view indicates an available map.  To the left of this view is a list
of the countries for which maps are available; above it is a list of the
various types of maps (land use, population, etc.).  The view just above
the map lists which map is being shown; the selected map is also highlighted
in the list of countries and map types.

<h1>Mars Images</h1>

<a href="http://pumori.cs.wisc.edu/mars.html">
  <img src="mars.gif" align=left alt="Mars images session"></a>
<br clear=left>

<br clear=left>
<p>This session shows images of Mars.  There are two sets of images: visible
light and pseudocolor for elevation.  The upper left and upper middle views
contain linked cursors that are used to select which images are shown in the
bottom views.  The view on the right shows the maximum versus the minimum
elevation for the area covered by each image.  The selected regions are
highlighted in yellow.
