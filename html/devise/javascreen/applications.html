<p>This session shows a peptide structure and related data.  The peptide
structure shown in the main view can be scaled and rotated.  The cursor
in the right view is used to select which residues are shown in the main
view (the selected residues are listed in the view just to the right of
the main view).  The view in the lower left corner is used to select
which parts of the structure (backbone, side chains, and hydrogens) are
shown in the main view.

<p>The view on the left lists the various chemical parameters that are
available for this peptide.  The cursor is used to select which parameter
is displayed in the bottom view.  The cursor in the bottom view selects
which residues are highlighted (green) in the main view.

<p>The two views on the left have lists of everyone who has used the
UW Comp Sci Condor pool within the last week (they can be scrolled with
the cursors on the extreme left).  In each user list, the cursor selects
a particular user, whose Condor usage is shown to the right (yellow
is total jobs, orange is running jobs).  The third ("Total") view on the
right shows jobs for all users.  The bottom view on the right also
shows jobs for all users, with a cursor that can be used to narrow the
range of time shown in the three views above.

<p>This session shows an animal's response to a visual stimulus.
The direction the animal is looking (gaze), head orientation (head),
and eye direction relative to the head (eye) are plotted over time.


<p>The views on the left show gaze, head, and/or eye orientation versus
time, and the views to their right show the derivatives versus time.
The views on the extreme right are used to select what is shown in the
main views.  You can see a particular graph on a larger scale by
selecting the graph you want, which will then expand to fill area
occupied by six views in the default setting.

<p>You can also select which trial(s) you want to see, and whether the
times should be synchronized with the appearance of the visual target
or the acquisition of the target.

<p>This session shows various maps of middle eastern countries.  The
selected map is obviously shown in the left view.  The cursor in the large
view on the right is used to select which map is shown.  Each square in
that view indicates an available map.  To the left of this view is a list
of the countries for which maps are available; above it is a list of the
various types of maps (land use, population, etc.).  The view just above
the map lists which map is being shown; the selected map is also highlighted
in the list of countries and map types.

<p>This session shows images of Mars.  There are two sets of images: visible
light and pseudocolor for elevation.  The upper left and upper middle views
contain linked cursors that are used to select which images are shown in the
bottom views.  The view on the right shows the maximum versus the minimum
elevation for the area covered by each image.  The selected regions are
highlighted in yellow.
