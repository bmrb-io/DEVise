<h1>Architectures</h1>

<p>DEVise 1.4 is currently available for the following architectures:
<ul>
<li>Intel/Solaris
<li>SPARC/Solaris
<li>SPARC/SunOS
<li>HPPA/HPUX
</ul>


<h1>Warning</h1>

<A HREF="1_4_warning.html">DEVise 1.4 warning.</A>


<h1>Setup Procedure</h1>

<p>If you do decide to run DEVise 1.4, here's how to go about it.

<ul>
<li>Go to the directory in which you want to have your DEVise files (a
'<tt>devise</tt>' directory will be created to hold them).
<li>Run the script <tt>/p/devise/public/set_up_user</tt>.
</ul>

<p>To run DEVise, go to the <tt>devise/run</tt> directory that the
<tt>set_up_user</tt> script created, and run <tt>devise</tt> or
<tt>devisepub</tt>.

<p><tt>devise</tt> runs DEVise with your own sessions, schemas, and data
sources (example files are installed in your <tt>devise</tt> directory).

<p><tt>devisepub</tt> runs DEVise with the public sessions, schemas, and
data sources.  (If you are not in the <tt>miron:devise</tt> AFS group,
you won't have write permissions on any of those files.)

<p>Note that a number of paths in your own DEVise files are relative paths.
This means that when you run <tt>devise</tt>, you <em>must</em> run it
from the <tt>devise/run</tt> directory unless you change all of the paths
to absolute paths.  You can run <tt>devisepub</tt> from anywhere.


<h1>Transitioning from 1.3</h1>

<p>If you already have sessions, schemas, and data that you have used in
DEVise 1.3, you can transition them to DEVise 1.4.  Sessions, schemas, and
data files can be used without changes, but the data source catalog must
be changed.

<p>To translate your 1.3 data source catalog to a 1.4 data source catalog,
follow this procedure:

<ul>
<li>Go to the directory where your 1.3 data source catalog
(<tt>sourcedef.tcl</tt>) is.
<li>Run the command "<tt>/p/devise/public/transcat.tcl &gt;
&lt;temp file&gt;</tt>".
<li>Edit <tt>&lt;temp file&gt;</tt> and remove the first two lines.
<li>Go to your <tt>devise/schema/schema directory</tt>.
<li>Copy <tt>catalog.dte</tt> (the DEVise 1.4 data source catalog file)
to <tt>catalog.dte.bak</tt> (it's very easy to corrupt the data catalog
in such a way that it won't work anymore).
<li>Edit <tt>catalog.dte</tt> and append <tt>&lt;temp file&gt;</tt> to it.
</ul>


<h1>Devise-sup Mailing List</h1>

<p>If you set yourself up to run DEVise 1.4, you should subscribe to the
devise-sup (DEVise support) mailing list.  This is a mailing list intended
to provide information to DEVise users and to allow them to pose questions
about using DEVise.  Subscribing to this mailing list will allow you to get
