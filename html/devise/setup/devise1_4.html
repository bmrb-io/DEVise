<h1>Architectures</h1>

<p>DEVise 1.4 is currently available for the following architectures:
<ul>
<li>Intel/Solaris
<li>SPARC/Solaris
</ul>

<h1>Warning</h1>

<p>DEVise 1.4 is not yet released software, so there are some things that
you should be aware of if you decide to use it:

<ul>
<li>The user documentation is not up-to-date, so many new features in 1.4
are not documented.
<li>Because DEVise 1.4 hasn't gone through release testing, some features
that worked in 1.3 no longer work in 1.4.
<li>New alpha releases of the software may occur at any time, and each
alpha release is not fully tested.
<li>The format of the data source catalog has changed between 1.3 and 1.4,
so you can't share data sources between them.
</ul>

<h1>Improvements</h1>

<p>Overall, DEVise 1.4 has many improvements relative to 1.3.  Some of these
improvements are:
<ul>
<li>Some SQL processing (select, join, group by, etc.) is available.
<li>Most data source types now use a new (more powerful) schema format.
<li>Tasvir (image display) and EmbeddedTk are launched automatically when
necessary.
<li>EmbeddedTk symbols work better.
<li>Some symbols can now be rotated.
<li>Text symbols can show non-string attributes.
<li>key configuration...
<li>can print PS from pixmaps
<li>It is now possible to use the Stop button during long draws.
<li>There are a number of improvements to the user interface.
<li>A number of bugs have been fixed.
<li>If you <em>do</em> find a bug, you're more likely to get it fixed in 1.3
than in 1.4.
<li>If you want to write your own DEVise client, there are improvements in
1.4 that make this an easier task than it is for 1.3.
<li>1.4 deals much more efficiently with data with large numbers of strings.
</ul>

<p>It's up to you to decide whether the improvements in 1.4 make dealing
with the hassles of alpha software worthwhile.  When there are big problems,
they usually get fixed pretty quickly, because those of us working on
the DEVise project all run 1.4.

<h1>Setup Procedure</h1>

<p>If you do decide to run DEVise 1.4, here's how to go about it.

<h1>Devise-sup Mailing List</h1>
