<h1>Architectures</h1>

<p>DEVise 1.11 is currently available for the following architectures:
<ul>
<li>i386/RHEL 5
</ul>

<h1>Setup Procedure</h1>

<p>If you do decide to run DEVise 1.11, here's how to go about it.

<ul>
<li>Go to the directory in which you want to have your DEVise files (a
'<tt>devise</tt>' directory will be created to hold them).
<li>Run the script <tt>/p/devise/release/public/set_up_user</tt>.
</ul>

<p>To run DEVise, go to the <tt>devise/run</tt> directory that the
<tt>set_up_user</tt> script created, and run <tt>devise</tt> or
<tt>devisepub</tt>.

<p><tt>devise</tt> runs DEVise with your own sessions, schemas, and data
sources (example files are installed in your <tt>devise</tt> directory).

<p><tt>devisepub</tt> runs DEVise with the public sessions, schemas, and
data sources.  (If you are not in the <tt>miron:devise</tt> AFS group,
you won't have write permissions on any of those files.)

<h1>Devise-sup Mailing List</h1>

<p>If you set yourself up to run DEVise 1.11, you should subscribe to the
devise-sup (DEVise support) mailing list.  This is a mailing list intended
to provide information to DEVise users and to allow them to pose questions
about using DEVise.  Subscribing to this mailing list will allow you to get
information such notices about alpha releases of a new version of DEVise.
