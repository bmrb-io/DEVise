<H1>Performance</H1>

DEVise is designed to handle large amounts of data from the ground up.
The following discussion assumes that the reader is already familiar
with the <A href="model.html">model of visualization</A>. DEVise
addresses performance as follows:

<UL>
<LI><A href="#IO">I/O</A>
<LI><A href="#Mapping">Mapping</A>
<LI><A href="#Drawing">Drawing GData</A>
<LI><A href="#Interface">User Interface</A>
<LI><A href="#Program">Program Design</A>
</UL>

<A name="IO"><H2>I/O</H2></A>

Minimizing the amount of accesses to disk is the goal of improving I/O
performance. It is not practical to rely on the virtual memory of a
workstation because thrashing readily occurs when the amount of data
is large. DEVise addresses I/O performance as follows:

<UL>
<LI>Buffer Manager: Ranges (not pages) of TData and
GData are retained in memory buffers. A non-LRU replacement
policy is used.
<LI>Query processor: decides which ranges of GData are accessed. It 
performs binary search for GData when sorted on the X attribute.
It fetches those GData in overlapping views only once. When the user is idle,
it converts TData into GData in the background. It can also
potentially incorporate prefetching and indexing.
<LI>mapping: reduces storage overhead by storing only those GData
attributes that change at run time.
</UL>

<A name="Mapping"><H2>Mapping</H2></A>

Mapping performance is improved as follows:

<UL>
<LI>compiled mapping: reduces time/space at run time. The time
is reduced through compilation. The space is reduced through
storing only those GData attributes that change at run time.
<LI>Caching: caching GData in the buffer and on disk eliminates the need to
perform mapping.
</UL>

<A name="Drawing"><H2>Drawing GData</H2></A>

Drawing performance is improved as follows:

<UL>
<LI>GData that overlap are drawn just once.
<LI>At low resolutions, GData are drawn as pixels. This is cheaper than
drawing complex shapes.
</UL>

<A name="Interface"><H2>User Interface</H2></A>

The user interface is designed to minimize the user response time:

<UL>
<LI>The layout mode (See <A href="visualQuery.html">visual query</A>.)
increases response time by not drawing the GData when the user
constructs a visual query.
<LI>Coming up for air: The query processor checks user actions periodically,
possibly aborting existing queries to act upon new user commands.
</UL>

<A name="Program"><H2>Program Design</H2></A>

The implementation is structured for performance as follows:

<UL>
<LI>Query abort: The ability to abort query throughout the design
of the DEVise components allows the user interface to abandon
existing updates to act on new user commands.
<LI>Batching: Transferring GData in batches instead of one
at a time reduces time spent in function calls.
<LI>Minimizing number of objects: In an object oriented environment,
everything is instantiated as an object. This is not done in DEVise, which
must handle large numbers of records.  Instantiating every 
input record as a shape object impedes performance.
