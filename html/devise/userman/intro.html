<p>DEVise (Data Exploration and Visualization) is a system that allows you
to easily develop, browse, and share visual presentations of large tabular
datasets (possibly containing or referencing multimedia objects) from several
sources.

<p>DEVise is aimed towards creating <em>dynamic</em>, not static
presentations (the 'Exploration' part of the name refers to this).  Please
keep this in mind as you use DEVise -- you will use it most effectively
if you dynamically explore your data rather than generating static images
or printouts.  Dynamically exploring your data will also take best advantage
of your own pattern recognition capabilities.

<p>We hope that DEVise will help you find out things about your
data -- perhaps even things you weren't specifically looking for.
