<H2>Input Data</H2>

The input data:
<UL>
<LI>are gathered from sensors stored in the ground.
<LI>contain attributes: data quality, date, solar radiation, rain, 
wind velocity, temperature, pressure, etc. 
</UL>

<P>The input file looks like:

<h2>Problem</H2>

We are trying to find lots of rain before a clear day.

<H2>Visualization</H2>

Click <A href="model.html">here</A> to see our model of creating
visualizations.

<P>The visualization is created as follows:
<OL>
<LI>Define Window 0 showing the global picture: solar radiation 
versus date, quality of solar radiation versus date, rain versus date,
and quality of solar radiation versus date.
<LI>link the X axes of the views.
<LI>Define Window 1 as a copy of Window 0. It shows a zoomed in
view.
<LI>Create a cursor to show the relationship between the Window 0 and
Window 1.
<LI>Navigate Window 1 to find areas where there are lots of 
rain before a clear day, using the top views are reference points.
<LI>Windows 2, 3, 4 and 5 are windows that have been duplicated, showing
possible places where there are lots of rain before a clear day.
</OL>


<H2>Observations</H2>
Here is a close up of a different window. The top two views are
global pictures of solar radiation and rain. The bottom two
views are zoomed in pictures.

<OL>
<LI>This example shows need need to generate different views
of the same data, and to keep track interesting places in the data.
<LI>Seasonal variation in the solar radiation observed for
the first view: high in the sumer, and low in the winter.
<LI>Seasonal variation in the rain observed for the
second view: high in the summer and spring.
<LI>Daily variation in the solar radiation, shown in the third
view: radiation is high around noon.
<LI>Lots of rain before a clear day observed for the 3rd and fourth views.
