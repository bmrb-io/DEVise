<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This page gives you a quick introduction on how to import data into
DEVise.  The assumption is that you have data in a file on local disk or
a URL.

<p>The following are the steps in importing data into DEVise:
<ol>
<li>Create the schema.
<li>Create the data source.
<li>Visualize the data source.
<li>Refine the visualization.
</ol>


<hr>
<h2>Define the schema</h2>

<p>The first step in importing data into DEVise is to define a schema that
applies to that data.  Select 'Physical' from the 'Schema' pull-right
menu of the 'Tables' menu.  You will see this window:
<p>
<img src="physical_schemas.gif" align=middle>

<p>Click on 'New', and you will now see the schema description window:
<p>
<img src="schema_description.gif" align=middle>

<p>This window allows you to define a schema for your data.  Fill in the
schema name, select the type (Ascii or Binary), enter the comment
character(s), and enter the separator or whitespace character(s);
then define the attributes.  You must define the attributes in the
order in which they appear in the records in your data file.  (All
records in a given file must have the same format.  Any records that
do not match the schema will be ignored.)  Once you've added all of
the attributes, click on 'Save'.


<hr>
<h2>Define the data source</h2>

<p>Select 'New Table' from the 'Tables' menu to get the 'Define Data
Stream' window:
<p>
<img src="define_data_stream.gif" align=middle>

<p>You can now define a data source by associating the file or URL containing
the data with the schema for that data.

<p>If your data is in a file, click on the 'Select' button to the right
of 'Key:'.  This will open the File select box:
<p>
<img src="file_select.gif" align=middle>

<p>Select the file containing your data.  Once you've selected the data
file, the File select box will automatically be shown again in order for
you to select the schema file.  Select the schema file you just defined
(the filename will be the same as the schema name you specified).

<p>If you want the display name of the data source to be different from
the data file name, change it now.  Then click 'OK'.

<p>If your data is accessed via a URL, change the data source type from
'UNIXFILE' to 'WWW'.  The rest of the procedure is basically
the same, except that instead of selecting the data with the File select
box, you must manually enter the URL in the Info/Command area of the
'Define Data Stream' window.


<hr>
<h2>Visualize the data source</h2>

<p>Select 'Visualize/Edit' from the Tables menu to open the 'Define
Visualization' window:
<p>
<img src="define_visualization.gif" align=middle>

<p>Select the following:
<ul>
<li>The window in which to visualize the data.
<li>The attribute to be graphed on the X axis.
<li>The type of view (bar chart, image, or scatter plot).
<li>The background color.
<li>Whether to use new mappings (in general, you should always do so).
<li>Whether to display title(s) in the view(s).
<li>Whether to link the X axes of the views if you create multiple views.
<li>Whether to display X axes.
<li>Whether to display Y axes.
<li>The attribute(s) to be graphed on the Y axis or axes.
</ul>

<p>Then click on 'OK'.

<p>If you selected two Y attributes, you should see a window
something like this:
<p>
<img src="data_window1.gif" align=middle>


<hr>
<h2>Refine the visualization</h2>

<p>Once you've visualized your data, you can change how it's visualized.
Select one view by clicking in it, then click the 'Mapping' button in
the DEVise main window; this shows the 'Edit Mapping' dialog:
<p>
<img src="mapping_dialog1.gif" align=middle>

<p>For example, we can change the color of the graph to be dependent on
the account ID:
<p>
<img src="mapping_dialog2.gif" align=middle>

<p>This results in the following visualization:
<p>
<img src="data_window2.gif" align=middle>

<p>By changing various attributes in the mapping, you can visualize the
data in many different ways.  There are also other, more advanced features
in DEVise, such as links and cursors.  For information on these features,
see the <a href=../userman.ps.gz> DEVise user manual</a>.
