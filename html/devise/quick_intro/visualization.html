<h2>Visualization:</h2>

<p>The top view (AccId vs. DATE) shows the account ID of each deposit on
the Y axis, versus the date on the X axis.

<p>The bottom view (Amount vs. DATE) shows the amount of each deposit on
the Y axis, versus the date on the X axis.  The color of each bar represents
the account ID into which the deposit was made.

<p>The two views are linked together on the X axis, so that if the user
zooms in on a particular range of dates in one view, the other view will
zoom to the same range of dates.
