<h2>Step 4: Refine the visualization.</h2>

<p>Once you've visualized your data, you can change how it's visualized.
Select one view by clicking in it, then click the 'Mapping' button in
the DEVise main window; this shows the 'Edit Mapping' dialog:
<p>
<img src="mapping_dialog1.gif" align=middle>

<p>For example, we can change the color of the graph to be dependent on
the account ID:
<p>
<img src="mapping_dialog2.gif" align=middle>

<p>This results in the following visualization:
<p>
<img src="data_window2.gif" align=middle>

<p>By changing various attributes in the mapping, you can visualize the
data in many different ways.  There are also other, more advanced features
in DEVise, such as links and cursors.  For information on these features,
see the <a href=../userman.ps.gz> DEVise user manual</a>.
