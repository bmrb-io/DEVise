<H1>Soil Science/BIRCH Clustering Example</H1>

<!-- Session is /p/devise/session/jussi/birch.tk -->

<H2>Input Data</H2>

The input data:
<UL>
<LI>is the result of clustering by
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~zhang/birch.html">BIRCH</a> on forest
canopy images.
<LI>contains the attributes: x, y, and color.
</UL>

<P>The input file looks like:
<TT>
<BR>39 1 6
<BR>45 1 6
<BR>50 1 6
<BR>...
</TT>

<h2>Problem</H2>

We want to view the results of clustering by BIRCH to refine the clustering
parameters until the clustering is satisfactory.

<H2>Visualization</H2>

Click <A href="model.html">here</A> to see our model of creating
visualizations.

<P>The visualization is created as follows:
<OL>
<LI>Define the 'Image Display' window.  This window simply displays each
record as a small rectangle of the specified color at the specified
location.  The color is determined by the cluster into which BIRCH put
that record (green is leaves, blue is branches, etc.).
</OL>

<H2>Observations</H2>
The clusters can be thought of as summaries of the underlying data.
It is important that the connection between the summaries and the underlying
data is preserved by DEVise.
