<H1>Program Traces Example</H1>

<H2>Input Data</H2>

The input data:
<UL>
<LI>are gathered from program traces from a materials science application.
The application is distributed across multiple workstations.
<LI>contain attributes: workstation number, job number, and starting and
ending time for each job.
</UL>

<P>The input file looks like:
<TT>
<BR>5 51 179 27 1
<BR>1 8 191 31 1
<BR>7 82 236 25 1
<BR>...
</TT>

<h2>Problem</H2>

We are trying to debug the program, and compare the performance of
different distributed algorithms.

<H2>Visualization</H2>
click <A href="model.html">here</A> to see our model of creating visualizations.

<P>The visualization is created as follows:
<OL>
<LI>Map each record, representing one computation, to a rectangle: 
workstation number on the Y axis, and time on the X axis. The length of 
the rectangle represents the length of each computation. Map 
job number to color.
<LI>Use the mouse button to fetch the actual records under the mouse pointer.
The records are displayed textually in a pop-up window.
</OL>

<H2>Observations</H2>
<OL>
<LI>This example is used to illustrate the mapping flexibility of DEVise.
<LI>Calculations occur in cycles.
<LI>Black rectangles are represented by aborted jobs: jobs
that have to be abandoned because a workstation is reclaimed by its user.
</OL>
