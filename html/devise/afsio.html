<H2>Input Data</H2>

The input data:
<UL>
<LI>are gathered from file server statistics.
<LI>contain attributes: date, time spent in cpu, idle, and user states,
and disk activities.
</UL>

<P>The input file looks like:
<BR>
<TT>
<BR>2 -2140595955 782593880(0/6/0.58)(0/17/1.48)(82/100/97.93)[0/205/7.3][0/8/0.18][0/8/0.35][0/8/0.22][0/8/0.18][0/8/0.15]{0/205/8.38}

<h2>Problem</H2>

We are trying to see if there is any anomalies between the file servers.

<H2>Visualization</H2>

click <A href="model.html">here</A> to see our model of creating visualizations.

<P>The visualization is created as follows:
<OL>
<LI>Define the two top views for first file server. In the first
view, map date onto X axis, and idle time to Y. In the
second view, map date onto X axis, and disk activity to Y axis.
Map high system activity to red.
<LI>Define the bottom two views the same as the top two, but for
a different sensor.
<LI>Link the X axes of all the views.
<LI>Navigate the views by scrolling or zooming.
</OL>

<H2>Observations</H2>
<OL>
<LI>This example illustrates the ability of DEVise to handle
large amounts of data. About 6 MB of memory buffer is used to 
visualize 18 MB of files.
<LI>Cycle in the data: low idle and high disk activity is observed
every night after midnight, during file backup.
<LI>Anomaly observed: The first server contains periods of high system
time, but the second file server does not.
</OL>
