<H2>Input Data</H2>

The input data:
<UL>
<LI>are gathered from medical records.
<LI>contain attributes: date, and number of visits per day 
for a respiratory disease.
</UL>

<P>The input file looks like:
<TT>
<BR>1/1/90    1 1 
<BR>1/2/90    6 10 
<BR>1/3/90    7 14 
<BR>...
</TT>

<h2>Problem</H2>

We are trying to see if the disease exhibits seasonal patterns.

<H2>Visualization</H2>
click <A href="model.html">here</A> to see our model of creating visualizations.

<P>The visualization is created as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Map each record to a bar. Date is mapped to the X axis, and
number of visits to the Y axis. Color is used to represent season
of the year: green = Spring, blue = Summer, orange = Fall, and
gray = Winter.
</OL>

<H2>Observations</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The disease is prevalent during seasonal changes, especially
between Fall and Winter, and between Winter and Spring.
</OL>
