<H1>Family Medicine/National Climate Data Center Example</H1>

<IMG src="fam_med_ncdc.gif">

<H2>Input Data</H2>

The input data:
<UL>
<LI>consists of two separate data sources: clinic information on the number
of visits, and NCDC information on the temperature in Madison.
<LI>the clinic visit information is local.
<LI>the temperature data is generated by the NCDC server as a result
of queries sent to its forms interface.
</UL>

<h2>Problem</H2>

Display the number of visits to the UW Family Medicine Clinic and the
temperature in Madison over a given time period, so that physicians can
look for correlations.

<H2>Visualization</H2>

Click <A href="model.html">here</A> to see our model of creating
visualizations.

<P>The visualization is created as follows:
<OL>
<LI>Define the 'Temperature, Jan 95' view with the NCDC server as its
data source.
<LI>Define the 'Clinic Visits, Jan 95' view with the local clinic data
as its data source.
<LI>Link X axes of these two views so that they display the same ranges
of data.
<LI>Define the 'Temperature, Jan 96' view with the NCDC server as its
data source.
<LI>Define the 'Clinic Visits, Jan 96' view with the local clinic data
as its data source.
<LI>Link the X axis of these two views.
</OL>

<H2>Observations</H2>
When a user zooms or scrolls on the data, the temperature data is updated
intelligently by requesting only the relevant data from the NCDC server.
