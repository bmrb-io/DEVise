#  Revision 1.3  1998/03/25 17:06:37  wenger
#  Another alternative for PERL_CORE.
#
#  Revision 1.2  1998/03/11 18:25:50  wenger
#  Got DEVise 1.5.2 to compile and link on Linux; includes drastically
#  reducing include dependencies between csgroup code and the rest of
#  the code, and within the csgroup code.  (Note: running collaboration
#  doesn't work yet.)
#
#  Revision 1.1  1998/03/04 18:40:21  wenger
#  Added <arch>/Makefile.config files that now hold stuff like the
#  PERL_CORE definitions so those don't have to be repeated in all
#  of the lower level makefiles; various other compile fixes; changed
#  version to 1.5.2.
