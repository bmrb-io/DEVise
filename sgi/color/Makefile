#  Got DEVise to link on SGI (haha) -- had to change things so that all
#  templates are implicit (they are still not implicit on other
#  architectures, to save space), had to use GNU's ar instead of SGI's,
#  various other kludges.

#  Revision 1.1  1998/02/26 18:55:14  wenger
#  Got everything to compile on haha -- still have a link problem, though.
