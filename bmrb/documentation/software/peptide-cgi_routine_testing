			Peptide-CGI Routine Testing
	$Id$

* OVERVIEW

This document details "routine" (manual) testing that should be done
to make sure Peptide-CGI, ChemShift, JavaScreen, and DEVise are working
properly at BMRB and the mirror sites.  This testing should be done at
least once a week; it is preferable to do at least a quick test of
BMRB every working day.

* TESTING THE NMR BROWSER

For each of the NMR browser URLs listed above, perform the following
procedure:

* Enter an accession number (possibly from the list below), and click
the "Open" button; then click the "Data Visualizations" link in the
resulting page.

* Look at Generation_date value in the visualization summary page and
make sure that it's "freshly" generated (remember time zones for the
mirror sites -- the generation date is in local time).  If the
visualizations are old (cached), go back and enter a different accession
number until you get a "fresh" set of visualizations.  (You can also
find entries to test by following the links when you drill-down in
the histogram visualizations -- see below.)

* Once you have a "fresh" visualization summary page, follow the links
to the various types of visualizations.  The most important ones to test
are the 3D structures and the chemical shift referencing (because they
are the most likely to fail).  Note that the chemical shift referencing
visualizations don't always work because of mismatches between the
BMRB and PDB entries, etc.  (See the list below for info.)  Also remember
that the chemical shift referencing visualizations are not available
at the Florence mirror (bmrb.postgenomicnmr.net).

* When you test a visualization, make sure that various functions such
as zooming, drilling down, etc., work.  For the 3D structure
visualizations, try selecting different data sets with the cursor in
the data select view; also test selecting different residues in the
data view and the structure selection dialog, and make sure they're
properly highlighted in the structure view.  (You can drill down in the
structure view to make sure the highlighted atoms match what is selected.)
Also make sure you can rotate and zoom the 3D structure.


* TESTING THE HISTOGRAMS

For each of the histogram URLs listed above, perform the following
procedure:

* Go to each of the histogram visualizations (Interactive Plots for
Protein Amino Acid Chemical Shift Distribution Histograms, Interactive
Histogram Plots for Amino Acid Chemical Shifts, RNA Chemical Shift
Histograms, DNA Chemical Shift Histograms).

* Make sure that both the amino acid or nucleotide selection cursor and
the atom selection cursor work (allowing you to visualize different
data sets).

* Zoom in to a level where individual histogram bars become distinct,
and drill down on one of the histogram bars (preferably one that doesn't
have a very large number of samples).  In the drill-down dialog, make
sure that you can click on one of the BMRB_entry links and get a new
browser tab or window containing that entry (you may have to disable
popup blocking in your browser for this to work).


* REPORTING PROBLEMS

If you run into any problems or errors, please report them to
devise-sup@cs.wisc.edu.
