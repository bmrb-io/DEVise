TEMPTEMP -- add stuff here

How to enable movies?:
- Run generate_movies
- Anything else?


command-line flags
what in session tells JS to enable buttons?
how does this propagate through peptide-cgi?

okay, yeah, I think there are special "hidden" views that have GData for
the buttons -- if the movies are disabled, the session doesn't send GData
to the JS for those views
JS treats buttons specially and doesn't display them in the view
"url_menu" in GData

what are config knobs?
does unedited movie have to exist for peptide-cgi to create button for
edited movie?

Note: working on this in $dev2/s2d_merge
why don't movie buttons show up for 4267 or 15562?
  it doesn't find the unedited movie
why doesn't s2p session show up at all for 5154?
  we don't even check for movies -- there's no predicted vs. experimental
  S2 data
  okay, looks like I have to change the url for the s2 predicted vs. experimental files...

how to re-generate demo page at cs (use 2.1 files...)
