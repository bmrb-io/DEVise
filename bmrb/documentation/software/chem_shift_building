* Building ChemShift

There are five basic steps in building ChemShift:
1) Install NMRPipe and MOLMOL.
2) Get the code.
3) Set up a config file.
4) Set up various directories, etc.
5) Compile the code.


This document will not include the details of installing NMRPipe and
MOLMOL.  This should be done before building ChemShift, however, since
the ChemShift configuration has to point to the NMRPipe and MOLMOL
installations.  (It should be possible to compile ChemShift without
an NMRPipe or MOLMOL installation, but it will not run successfully.)


Generally, you get the ChemShift code by checking out the ChemShift
module from the repository in /cvsmain at BMRB.


To set up a config file, you should copy or link the appropriate
cs_config_* to cs_config (take a guess depending on where you're building
the software).  Then modify cs_config as necessary.


Once you have your cs_config set up, run the command:

    make setup


To actually compile the software, go into the src directory and run
the command:

    make all

If the compile works properly, you will end up with an ChemShift.jar file
in the src directory.


* Notes about s2d.jar

ChemShift currently uses some of the s2d (Peptide-CGI) classes for
parsing NMR-STAR files.  Because Peptide-CGI is in CVS at CS instead
of BMRB, we just commit an s2d.jar file to CVS as part of the ChemShift
sources.  This, of course, means that we have to manually update the
s2d.jar file to get new versions of the Peptide-CGI classes.  However,
ChemShift uses fairly low-level classes from Peptide-CGI, so most
Peptide-CGI changes don't affect ChemShift.
