   How to compile this stuff (version 5.0)
   ---------------------------------------

   Included in this package is an Imakefile which generates an example
program and, optionally, makes and installs a linking library, header
file and manual pages. For those people without imake, or who can't get
it to work, a Makefile.std is also includes.

   To configure the package, edit `xvertext.tmpl' if you want to use imake,
or the `Makefile.std' if not. You may which to change the cache status, and/or
the directories used for any installing. If you have X11R3, indicate this.

   If you have imake, type:

         xmkmf
         make Makefiles

   to create the Makefiles, else

         cp Makefile.std Makefile

   if you haven't.

   Typing `make example' produces the example program `example'. Run it. 
Depending on your machine you might be pleasantly :-) or unpleasantly :-(
surprised! (Note that if your server memory is small and limited, such as
in an X terminal, the example program may fail with in `insufficient resources'
error. Try turning the cache off in this case, and destroying some other
windows - but not this one!)

   Typing `make libXrot.a' (or just plain `make') calls `ar' to produce an
archive	file libXrot.a. Typing `make install' installs this and the header 
file rotated.h.

   Typing `make install.man' installs the manual pages.

   Successful compilations
   -----------------------

   The programs in this package have been successfully compiled and
run by myself on:

   o HP 9000s300, 9000s700 and 9000s800 machines
   o Solbournes running SunOS 4.1.1
   o A Sequent Symmetry running DYNIX

   and on many other machines by other people. Good luck with anything else :-)
