			DEVise Version History

DEVise 1.11.5
-------------

(Nothing yet.)


DEVise 1.11.4
-------------

* Got DEVise to compile on CentOS 6.

* Got DEVise to compile on RHEL 6.

* Changed colors of the Tcl/Tk GUI.

* Partially fixed bug 1008 (non-existant data files cause DEVise to crash).


DEVise 1.11.3
-------------

* Fixed DEVise/JS bug 1024 (JS data download problem).

* Fixed DEVise/JS bugs 1027 and 1028 -- we now re-make DEVise tmp and
work dirs before we try to use them, in case /tmp cleaner has
removed them.

* Fixed DEVise bug 1022 (the "reset axis ranges" command should re-run
the session post script).

* Fixed bug 1017 (cursor type flag not being saved properly).

* Enabled better JavaScreen command error messages; a few other
improvements to debug output.


DEVise 1.11.2
-------------

* Added provision for JavaScreen data download.

* Fixed a problem that sometimes prevented the "Open Session" dialog
from being able to move up a directory (see bug 1021).

* Got the external process capability working again, and set up an
example session.


DEVise 1.11.1
-------------

* Made the code for deciding when to hide session files for the JavaScreen
slightly more permissive, so session switching will work for the BMRB
visualization server.

* Fixed bug 1002 (current axis ranges not always preserved correctly
on JavaScreen resize).

* Added a number of options to improve cursor behavior, especially for
cursors whose destination view is a view symbol whose TData or parent
value are switched by its parent.


DEVise 1.11.0
-------------

* Added the "all" option to GAttrLinks -- when turned on, a string value
of "all" or "All" in the leader view's GData attribute selects all
records in the follower view(s).


DEVise 1.10.2
-------------

* Fixed DEVise bug 924 (DEVise sends cursor commands to JS for hidden
views).

* Fixed DEVise bug 923 (DEVise sends GData to JS for hidden views).


DEVise 1.10.1
-------------

* Fixed bug 996 (certain combinations of cursor actions in the JavaScreen
could cause DEVise to crash).

* Fixed bug 997 (problem with -allowCore flag).


DEVise 1.10.0
-------------

* Starting development and stable series versioning.


DEVise 1.9.1
------------

* Added new 'isAngle' field to the mapping for HighLow symbols -- if
this is turned on, the HighLow symbols treat the data as angles
from -180 to 180 degrees, with special provision for angles that
"wrap around" the -180 to 180 boundary (low > high in the data).

* Added the capability to exclude specific views in a pile from drill-
down.

* Added the selectParent, selectFirstChild, and selectNextChild
commands to help in editing complex sessions.

* Added parent view names to view names (optionally) displayed in views
(to help in editing complex sessions).

* Added clearGlobalFilterHistory command to clean up session files
(especially for things like Peptide-CGI templates).

* Changed mapped dialog so that all shape attributes are always displayed
(because we use "non-active" shape attributes for GAttr links).

* Fixed a problem that caused the DEVised to core dump on x86_64/Centos 5
when sending string GData to the JavaScreen client.

* Fixed a problem that sometimes caused DEVise to free the same FontStruct
twice.

* More flexible generation of font names (horizontal and vertical resolution
are no longer specified).

* Added -allowCore command-line flag that overrides limits on core dump
size, if possible.

* We now print the core dump size limit at startup.

* Fixed bug 932 (axis multiplication factor not copied in view copy).

* Added the "-defaultFont" command-line argument to allow DEVise to
at least run when we have a very limited selection of fonts.

* Added some new functionality to the HighLow symbol type for displaying
angles in the BMRB torsion angle restraint visualizations.  (If the new
'Is angle' shape attribute is set to true, the HighLow symbol has special
provisions for displaying values that "wrap around" the -180 to 180 degree
boundary.)

* Improved some PileStack error messages.

* Code cleanup, fixed compile warnings (many relating to string const-
ness), valgrind, etc.


DEVise 1.9.0
------------

* Added support for Jmol in the JavaScreen -- added a flag for whether or
not 3D views should use Jmol.

* Added X Offset to Bar and Segment shapes (for NRG visualization for
Luis Populin).

* Added the new setDoHomeOnVisLinkIfInvisible and
getDoHomeOnVisLinkIfInvisible commands (to fix a problem with the example
 session for Luis Populin), and fixed a bug in getDoHomeOnVisLink.

* Added info about mapping, view, and window creation parameters
to saving of session files; updated all example sessions accordingly.

* Added "Misc. View Properties" dialog to control things we haven't
had a GUI for previously.


DEVise 1.8.1
------------

* Fixed bug 929 (drill-down on empty data source crashes DEVise).


DEVise 1.8.0
------------

(Entries below here also included in 1.9.0.)

* Somewhat kludgily fixed DEVise bug 917/919 (drill-down works
poorly on fixed text symbols) -- expanded visual filter for
query because we don't know the bounding box of the symbols.

* Got DEVise to build and run on Centos Linux.

* Got Tasvir to build and run on CentOS.

* Added CentOS support to the release script.


DEVise 1.7.19
-------------

* Fixed bug 902 (zooming in too far makes lines disappear).

* Fixed bug 911 (DEVise can't open DOS-format session files).

* Fixed bug 905 (problem redrawing child views that send GData to the
JavaScreen).

* Added new color palette for "figure of merit" colors for Pistachio
visualization.

* Added comment to session file (in the view section) that tells what
mapping a view uses.

* Fixed bug 913 (shape attrs 11-14 get cleared by apply in mapping
dialog).

* Mapping dialog prints out mapping name (to help with manual session
editing).

* Workaround for DEVise bug 915 (problem with home/links/piles).

* Better error messages in CheckAndMakeDirectory(); provision
in Exit::DoExit() to avoid recursion.

* Fixed bug 914 ('Select Next in Pile' doesn't work on 3D views).

* ClientAPI code now logs errors via the DevError class (added
DebugLogDummy to the client library so this works for devise
and collaborator, which don't link the full graphics.new lib).

* Fixed a bunch of possible buffer overflows (sprintfs and
strcats) in DeviseCommand.C and Dispatcher.c; changed a bunch
of fprintfs() to reportErr*() so the messages go into the
debug log; various const-ifying of function arguments.

* Removed all fixed dependencies on having a /p/devise directory.

* Fixed bug 890 (problems with drill-down dialog caused by
some color palettes not having a pure white color).

* Fixed bug 578/741 (can't display a data source from the "Edit
Data Source" dialog).

* Better error messages if we can't find a TData.

* Improved error messages if Tcl or Tk initialization fails.

* Many improvements to example sessions.


DEVise 1.7.18
-------------

* Fixed bug 899 (problem with copying views).

* "Current filter does not match last history filter" warning is now
only shown if DEBUG is turned on in View.c.

* Added more "home debug" output.

* Cleaned up session files by putting blank lines between objects.

* Added new 'select next view in pile' feature.

* Removed 'whoami' and 'rmmem' from DEVise startup scripts, etc.

* Added separate compilation and release for RedHat 7.2 and RedHat 9.

* RedHat 9 support.

* Major drill-down improvements: hitting a symbol is more forgiving; drill-
down now works properly on views that are GAttr link followers; drill-
down works better on views with count mappings; other drill-down bug fixes.

* Support for alternate colors for printing.

* Improvements to view copying (added in a few properties that were
previously missing).

* JavaScreen support for print color modes is now in place.

* Print mode symbol colors default to white instead of black for mappings
whose only symbol type is 'view' (so child view backgrounds are white).


DEVise 1.7.17
-------------

* Added initial value option to count mapping, also GUI for it (this is
needed for chem shift reference visualizations).

* More buffer length checks (still many more needed) in DeviseCommand.C.

* Changed print defaults to file and GIF (instead of printer and
PostScript).

* Fixed bug 886 (home problem).

* Fixed bug 885 (Y min zero on automatic home doesn't work).

* Fixed bug 871 (home doesn't work right on GAttribute link followers).

* Fixed a bug in that the intersection of multiple GAttr links was
not being computed correctly.



DEVise 1.7.16
-------------

* SPARC/Solaris version now compiled on Solaris 2.8 (to hopefully fix
dynamic library problems the Japan BMRB mirror was having).

* Changed things so the GUI doesn't get so screwed up if we can't run
'ls' (this happened because of AFS problems).


DEVise 1.7.15
-------------

* Many improvements to "sandbox" examples.

* Changing a child view's parent value now activates automatic visual
filter updates.

* Various minor bug fixes.

* Fixed (I think) bug 875 -- invalid TData record problem seen by
Wavelet-IDR.

* Significant improvements to the "view home" code.

* Fixed a problem with error bars being drawn incorrectly.

* Added a command-line argument to disable external-process capability
(for security), defaults to being disabled in JavaScreen support;
a little fixing up of the external-process stuff.

* Greatly improved the error message when DEVise can't read
composite.ini.

* Minor improvements to the debug logs.

* More changes to try to fix bug 875 (invalid TData record problem seen by
Wavelet-IDR).

* Index file names for per-session data sources now include the session
name (to reduce collisions); fixed a few memory problems relating to
the data source catalogs.

* Fixed bug 876 (pixel overflow errors in duplicate elimination code).

* Various improvments to debug logging; moved command logs from /tmp
to work directory.

* Added timestamps to devise error info printed to stderr.

* Fixed bug 880 (RectX symbols always cause external process call).


DEVise 1.7.14
-------------

* Fixed a number of bugs related to view geometry, transforms, and axis
drawing.

* Added "link multiplication factor" feature.

* Fixed bugs relating to axis drawing with axis multiplication factors
other than 1.

* Fixed bug 862 (single-pixel rectangles don't work in JavaScreen support
mode).

* Added union capability for multiple GData attribute links (will help
with restraint visualizations for BMRB).

* Fixed bug 859 (equal-width bars sometimes show up with unequal widths).

* Fixed bugs 858 and 864 (more drawing bugs).

* Fixed bug 865 (axis problem with negative multiplication factors).
