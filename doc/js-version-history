			JavaScreen Version History

JavaScreen 5.7.0
----------------
(With DEVise 1.9.0.)

* Added the option to render 3D molecules with Jmol:
- Jmol is embedded within the JavaScreen.
- Added Jmol menus to the JavaScreen menu bar.
- Added trees to select which atoms are shown and highlighted within
  Jmol.

* Improved fonts -- larger, buttons/menus are now sans-serif.

* A number of improvements to debug logging and restarts.

* Added timestamps to many more items in the JSPoP debug output.

* A bunch of changes to improve restart logging, etc.:
- Better error messages in jss.java.
- Set maximum memory for all production Java server processes to
  256 MB (because of weird problems on marlin.bmrb.wisc.edu).
- DEVise.jspop and DEVise.jspop.loc send all start_devised output to
  a log file instead of to /dev/null.
- check_jspop now puts check_connect.err.* in logs and doesn't
  delete it when there's an error.
- run_check puts *starting* timestamp at beginning of output, saves
  output from failed tests to logs.
- start_devised generates more output, now that it's being saved.
- Better error messages from check_jsall, check_jspop, and check_jss.


JavaScreen 5.6.0
----------------
(With DEVise 1.8.0.)

* JS now sends 3D coordinate updates only when it really needs to
(when it's a collaboration leader).

* Changed configuration for "regular" and "wavelet" JavaScreens
to kill Xvfb (since most of the JSPoP restarts these days seem
to be because Xvfb gets goofed up).

* Changed the subject of error emails from run_check to put the
JS ID and machine name closer to the beginning, so they show up
better.

* Changed JavaScreen scripts from sh to bash because of problems
at Osaka -- their sh didn't accept the -e test.


JavaScreen 5.5.2
----------------
(With DEVise 1.7.19.)

* Check_jspop now always deletes the check_connect.err.* file.

* Improvements to JS usage statistics script: now deals with the fact
that the logs seem to be in local time instead of GMT; error messages
if parsing time fails; prints a warning if there's no JSPoP pid file.

* Changed JavaScreen config files to work on teal instead of pumori.

* Run_check now touches a file in /tmp/.X11-unix to make sure that
directory stays "fresh" and doesn't get deleted.

* Added dev_vis.loc for JS to use local sessions, etc., that
come with standard DEVise distribution; DEVise.jspop script
makes the "base" session temp directory.

* Added config file for BMRB Italy mirror.

* Added DEVise.jspop.loc that runs with the "local" sessions, etc.

* Added scripts to report JS usage on teal.

* We now exlude any host name *starting* with localhost from the
"real" session open statistics.

* Added new options to JavaScreen configuration so we don't have
to rely on there being a /p/devise.

* New config file for framenet.cs.wisc.edu (new server).

* Added JS usage script for framenet.

* Got DEVise/JavaScreen to work on basslet by turning off hangCheck.

* More improvements to the JSPoP debug logging.

* A possible fix to some of the JSPoP hangs we've been experiencing.

* More fixes relating to the JSPoP hanging problems on pumori.

* More diagnostic output.

* More JSPoP reliability improvements.

* JSPoP reliability improvements (no longer experimental).


JavaScreen 5.5.1
----------------
(With DEVise 1.7.18?)

* Much-improved JSPoP debug logging capabilities.

* Removed DEViseJSLoader references from html files, jsa or jsb is now
loaded directly (fixes "half-screen" problem seen on Windows).


JavaScreen 5.5.0
----------------

* Restart_jspop gives an explicit error message if there's no bin2
directory.

* "Option" dialog now displays JSPoP and DEVise version, and JSPoP ID.

* JSPoP prints version and arguments to log file at startup.

* New version of JavaScreen usage stats script gets info from
jspop.usage.* files, gives non-UW counts.

* Fixed a collaboration bug (race condition could cause a wrong command
to get sent to the devised).

* Support for alternate colors for printing.

* Changed most buttons in the JavaScreen GUI to menus (to save space
in preparation for adding new functionality).

* We now report the system's uptime on a JSPoP restart, so we can tell
when restarts are triggered by system reboots.

* Non-applet JS now continues without dialog if it can't get the animation
symbols.

* Fixed bug 889 (erroneous JSPoP restarts seen at BMRB because hostname
lookup took an extremely long time).

* (Temporary) Extra debug output to try to track down recent JSPoP
restarts.


JavaScreen 5.4.2
----------------

* Non-applet JS now continues without dialog if it can't get the animation
symbols.

* Fixed bug 889 (erroneous JSPoP restarts seen at BMRB because hostname
lookup took an extremely long time).


JavaScreen 5.4.0
----------------

* Restart_jspop gives an explicit error message if there's no bin2
directory.

* "Option" dialog now displays JSPoP and DEVise version, and JSPoP ID.

* JSPoP prints version and arguments to log file at startup.

* New version of JavaScreen usage stats script gets info from
jspop.usage.* files, gives non-UW counts.

* Fixed a collaboration bug (race condition could cause a wrong command
to get sent to the devised).


JavaScreen 5.3.0
----------------
(With DEVise 1.7.15?)

* JSPoP (but not JSS or DEVised) now use a new CircularLog class, so the
log file doesn't grow out of control.

* Session opens are now logged in a separate JS usage log.

* All sessions with any hidden directories in their paths are now
hidden in the session lists returned to the JavaScreen (for  (for BMRB
visualization server -- allows a session in a hidden directory to
be opened by passing in the name, but then the user can't see any
other sessions in that directory).

* There is now a configuration option to kill Xvfb when killing the
JSS (to deal with the problem that once in a while Xvfb gets itself
goofed up and you cannot successfully restart the DEViseds unless you
kill Xvfb first).

* Fixed bug 872 (double append to path in JS open session dialog).

* Minor improvements to the debug logs.

* Added closeSession() and openSession() methods to the JS applet for
Wavelet-IDR.

* Added id, directory, and hostname header to JS usage stats.

* JSPoP debug log improvements to try to track down the cause of some
DEVised restarts.

* JSPoP (but not JSS or DEVised) now use a new CircularLog class, so the
log file doesn't grow out of control.

* Session opens are now logged in a separate JS usage log.

* Changed JavaScreen scripts so things work even if the user has
CLASSPATH defined; restart_jspop gives warning if sleeping because
of lock file.

* jss_savepid *always* tries to start Xvfb, in case the file in
/tmp/.X11-unix is there in error; got rid of path stuff in run_check.

* Added closeSession() and openSession() wrapper methods to
DEViseJSLoader (should have done that before).


JavaScreen 5.2.2
----------------

* Fixed bugs relating to axis drawing with axis multiplication factors
other than 1.

* Made refreshAllData() and restartSession() methods in DEViseJSLoader,
so that the Wavelet-IDR JavaScript code can call them.

* Fixed problems with JSPoP restarts overlapping.

* Script fixes so BMRB mirror sites can generate JS usage stats.

* Various updates to the BMRB mirror site installation instructions,
including info on setting up the JS usage statistics.

* Fixed bug 866 (JSPoP hangs on bad collaboration name from follower).

* Fixed bug 870 (JS follower crash goofs up leader also).

* Made JS invisibility destruction timeout configurable; fixed some other
problems with loading and re-loading the applet.

* JavaScreen startup scripts now set DEVised fontkludge argument
automatically.

* Eliminated or reduced "Abrupt end of input stream reached" errors in
the JSPoP on normal client exit.
