There are two basic ways to generate print files using DEVise:

- Start the full DEVise executable each time there is a request for a print.

- Have the DEVise server running all the time, and only start the DEVise
  client for each print request.

In general, the second way is preferable because it will give faster
response times, but either way will work.


You should start devise with the following command line:

    devise -session <session file> -batch <batch file>

or 
    devisec [-h <server machine>] [-q] <session file> <batch file>

    (Assuming devised is already running.  If devised is running on a
    different machine than devisec, you must use the -h argument to tell
    devisec which machine to connect to.)

    -q is for quiet mode (less output).

Example batch file:

    DEVise setFilter {Y vs. X} 11.13 6.68 17.30 9.74
    PrintActual 0 "" /tmp/example 1 GIF 0 0 0 0
    DEVise exit

This batch file shows an example of setting the visual filter for a view
before printing.  If you want to allow web users to set the range of data
to be shown, you can have your CGI script generate the setFilter command
based on input from the user.  Note that you can have any valid DEVise
command in a batch file.

PrintActual arguments:
    to printer: whether to print a physical page -- set this to 0 (no).
    print cmd: the command to use if you want to print to a printer -- set
	this to "" for printing to a file.
    file name: the name of the file to generate -- if you print a GIF,
        .gif (if you print all windows) or .0.gif (if you print a single
	window) will be appended to this name.
    print src: what to print:
	0: print the selected window (not very useful for batch mode because
	    you have to select a view before you print).
	1: print all windows (prints windows to separate files).  This is
	    probably what you want; you should probably set up your session
	    to have only one window.
	2: print the display (all windows in one image) (this doesn't
	    seem to work in batch mode).
	3: print all views.
    format: what output format you want -- set this to GIF or PostScript.
    map: 0 for now, more info on this to come.
    mapfile: 0 for now, more info on this to come.
    url: 0 for now, more info on this to come.
    default url: 0 for now, more info on this to come.

DEVise setFilter arguments:
    view name: the name of the view for which you want to set the visual
	filter (see the session file to find out the name).
    x low: x low of new filter
    y low: y low of new filter
    x high: x high of new filter
    y high: y high of new filter
