#  Updated public data, schemas, sessions, etc., to work with DEVise 1.4.
#
#  Revision 1.4  1997/01/31 16:25:10  wenger
#  Changed set_up_user to put the devise scripts in run subdirectory to
#  be consistent with the distribution tar files; changed the session files
#  and data catalog to work with this.
#
#  Revision 1.3  1996/12/15 20:24:50  wenger
#  set_up_user no longer forces devise directory to be in home; copies
#  data from dat instead of dat_local.

#  Some improvements to make it working in cs department afs.
