			How to Deal with Branches in CVS
		$Id$

Here are some notes on how to deal with branches in CVS.

NOTE:  all cvs commands shown below MUST be given at the TOP level of
the sources to establish a branch for all of the sources.  This is
probably the safest thing to do -- I haven't created branches for only
part of the sources so far.

NOTE:  the exact form of the tag names that you use is obviously up to
you; I've found that the form shown below works pretty well for keeping
track of what's going on.  You end up using a lot of tags on branches,
so it's good to decide on some form at the beginning of the branch, and
stick with it.

There are several sections below:

* Creating the branch and getting code onto the branch.
* Committing and merging.
* Getting off of the branch.


CREATING THE BRANCH AND GETTING CODE ONTO THE BRANCH

Note:  this assumes that you want to create a branch starting from the
versions of source files that you currently have checked out.  There are
other ways to create branches, but this document doesn't currently deal
with them.

* Possibly update your sources.  You should do this only if you're
  confident that you can update your sources without having too many
  conflicts (hopefully it hasn't been too long since the last time
  you updated).

* Put a tag in the cvs trunk.  This tag shows where the branch diverges
  from the trunk.  Give the command:

    % cvs tag <name>_base

  where <name> is the name that you're using for your branch; for example,

    % cvs tag foobar_base

* Create the branch.  The command given below will create the branch
  starting at the version of sources you currently have checked out:

    % cvs tag -b <name>_br

  for example,

    % cvs tag -b foobar_br

* Get your sources onto the branch:

    % cvs update -r <name>_br

  Note that doing this command should not actually do any merging or change
  your source files in any way -- it just puts a sticky tag on them so that
  CVS knows that you're on the branch.

  If you need another copy of the branch sources, or someone else wants to
  work on them, do:

    % cvs checkout -r <name>_br

  This will check out the latest version of all sources on the branch.

* Make sure your sources are on the branch.  You can do this by running
  the 'cvs status' command on some of your source files.  If you are on
  the branch, cvs status will report that a file's Sticky Tag is the
  branch tag, for example:

    % cvs status release

    File: release           Status: Up-to-date

       Working revision:    1.21    Fri Mar 13 20:11:25 1998
       Repository revision: 1.21    /p/devise/cvs/./release,v
       Sticky Tag:          foobar_br (revision: 1.21)
       Sticky Date:         (none)
       Sticky Options:      (none)

* Put a tag on the branch:

    % cvs tag <name>_br_0

  for example,

    % cvs tag foobar_br_0


COMMITTING AND MERGING

* Commit code on the branch.  Once your code is on the branch, any commits
  that you do will automatically be commits on the branch.

* Merging.  You can merge either from the branch to the trunk, or vice
  versa.  WHEN YOU DO A MERGE IT IS VITAL THAT YOU TAG BOTH THE BRANCH
  AND THE TRUNK.  If you don't do this, it may not be possible to do
  subsequent merges without re-merging code that has already been merged,
  thereby causing errors.  I've been using tags like <name>_br_1, <name>_br_2,
  etc., on the branch, and mgd_thru_<name>_br_1, etc., on the trunk (merging
  from branch to trunk).

* Merging from trunk to branch.  Here's what you need to do to do this:

    * Tag the branch; for example:

	% cvs tag <name>_br_1

      (if this is the first merge of the branch code).

    * Check out a fresh copy of the trunk sources, merging the branch changes:

	% cvs checkout -j <name>_br_1 world

      It's best to dump the output of this command into a file, to make
      the next step easier.

      If this is not the first merge from the branch, you need to do
      something like:

	% cvs checkout -j <name>_br_1 -j <name>_br_2 world

      THE ORDER OF THE -J OPTIONS IS IMPORTANT.  You generally need to put
      the older branch tag first.  If you put the new branch tag first, you
      will REMOVE the changes made between the two tags.

    NOTE:  you can also do the merge with a 'cvs update' command, but I've
    had better luck doing it with 'cvs checkout'.

    * Fix any conflicts in the merge.  Look through the output of the 'cvs
      checkout', searching for the word 'conflict'; manually fix any files
      where there are conflicts.

    * Compile and run DEVise and make sure that all of the changes from the
      branch have gotten incorporated.

    * Commit the merged version.

    * Tag the trunk:

	% cvs tag mgd_thru_<name>_br_1

* Merging from branch to trunk.  I haven't actually done this yet, and the
  cvs info isn't totally clear on it, but I suspect that you first need to
  tag the trunk, and then update the branch, something like:

    (on trunk) % cvs tag xyz

    (on branch) % cvs update -j <name>_base -j xyz

* Other merging.  There are other merging possibilities, such as merging
  from one branch to another, that are not covered in this document, and
  can hopefully be avoided.

GETTING OFF OF THE BRANCH

    % cvs update -A

  will get you back to the trunk.  It's best to have all of your branch
  code committed before you do this.
