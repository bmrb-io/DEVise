		To-do 14.006: Clean up release/distribution
				2015-12-22

My current thought on how to do this with minimal changes is to
make new release scripts that release things to a new directory
within the source tree.  Then the distribution scripts would
get the binaries from there, instead of from /p/devise/release.

I think it should probably still be possible to release things
to /p/devise/release, although ideally we'd be able to do that
by untarring the distribution tarball(s) and making some target
that comes as part of those.

(Part of my goal with this is to generally simplify the process,
and make the order more logical (create tarballs, then release to
/p/devise/release instead of the other way around).  And part of
my goal is to set things up so that distribution tarballs can
be created on any appropriate machine, without access to the CS
AFS cell.
