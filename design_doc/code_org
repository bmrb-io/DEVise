  other things such as the Dispatcher.
    Lines of code: 52891

* graphics.new: this is the 'everything but the kitchen sink' directory.

  to display the PVM traces.  This version of DEVise is not built at the
  present time because the code has not compiled since the color manager was
  incorporated into DEVise.
