		Things to (possibly) do to DEVise
			$Revision$


ACTIVE
------
Improve control of fonts. (ml/rkw 11/19/96)

Be able to save schemas to a "TData file". (ml/rkw 6/13/96)

Remove sourceList() dependencies from the front-end.  Right now, the
front-end has to consult its catalogs to get information about streams
that are fully defined in the back-end.  If the proper DEVise API
commands were added, this would not be necessary.  The advantage is
that streams can be defined without being defined at the front-end,
but the front-end can still be used to create new views, etc. (kb 8/2/96)

Make automated test scripts. (rr/rkw 1/9/97)

Port DEVise to Windows NT.

Move LineWidth from ShapeAttr3 to its own Gdata spot, next to Pattern.
Should LineWidth be absolute pixel size, or in user coords? 
How should the LineWidth be handled for the Line symbol?
The LineWidth might need to be stored in the PointStorage.
Large line width for Line plots doesn't look right. (kb 9/4/96)

Support for custom colors and/or user defined color palette (kb 9/5/96)

Eliminate color names (do everything by RGB).  (See notes in
graphics/PostScript.doc.)  (ml/rkw 11/12/96)


HIGH PRIORITY
-------------
Handling of derived data sources must be moved out of the Tcl code and
into the C++ code (see derivedSourceList Tcl variable). (rkw 9/19/97)

GUI for printing needs improvement. (ml/rkw 2/19/97)

Fix speed problem for some sessions in Linux (try the LL.tk sesssion).
(rr/ml/rkw 2/19/97)

Major source code reorganization. (rkw 1/9/97)

Be able to use the mapping dialog to change some values for all views in
a window (for example, change the symbol for all views from bars to lines).
There should be a "keep the same" selection for attributes where you
don't want to change the values.
(ml/rkw 12/16/96)

Update examples on Devise web page. (ml/rkw 9/6/96)


LOW PRIORITY
------------
Work on putting "handles" on symbols (rectangles, etc.) in DEVise.
Eventually be able to drag them with mouse, but first step is just showing/
hiding them.  Must be a method of object(s). (ml ?/?/96)


NOT YET PRIORITIZED
-------------------
Allow changing all views using a given TData to another TData. (ml/rkw 6/13/96)

Allow multiple TData catalogs. (ml/rkw 6/13/96)

Make a GUI for defining portions of files as data sources. (ml/rkw 6/4/96)

Make a GUI for specifying which TDatas to save to session file when
exporting a template with data. (ml/rkw 6/4/96)

Make some kind of graphical browser/editor for session files. (ml/rkw 6/4/96?)

Improve error handling (rkw/jpm/gc 6/28/96)

Reduce unnecessary interclass dependencies/extra includes (rkw/jpm ?/?/96)

Avoid seeks for advancing short distances by reading and throwing away
data (jpm/rkw ?/?/96)

Make depends need to be improved so that they find include files in other
devise directories. (kb/rkw 7/31/96)

Clean up unused/unneeded sources.  Reorganize source tree (at least
get rid of graphics/graphics.new) and make naming consistent (.c/.C). 
(kb/rkw 7/31/96)

Have the ability to have null values in records. (kb/rkw 7/31/96)

Improvements to selection/projection, etc., as per meetings of 5/13/96.

Move handling of special format (e.g. business school) data to V-engine.

Moving averages, weighted statistics, weighted moving averages (kb 8/2/96)

Detect and reject duplicate definitions of windows, views, etc. (kb 8/2/96)

Session groups - The ability to open two or more sessions, which get
merged together, except that there is a namespace (maybe) for each one
and they can be closed individually. (ml/kb 8/2/96)

Catalogs - The current catalog is not type safe - objects are cast to
and from void*, without any checks to make sure that it is the right
type of object.  If the user sends a window name as a view name, it
will crash the backend.  If the catalogs were kept on a per type
basis, eg, a view catalog, a window catalog, etc., and the user always
specified the type with any request (eg 'find view X'), then it
becomes type safe, and there is a seperate namespace for each type of
object (ie, there can be a 'time' link, a 'time' cursor, and a 'time'
window).  Another possiblility is to have the backend return handles
(oids) to objects (that should be checked for validity) which the
frontend uses for subsequent requests.  This would allow object names
to easily change, and more than one object of the same type could
exist in the catalog (good for session merging).  (kb 8/2/96)

Configurable keys.  We can create a set of 'devise actions' that allow
the user to define their own keyboard mappings.  We could also define
a devise action that just forwards the request to the front-end (the
user could define the space key as 'control_panel(raise)', and the
CNTL-C key as 'control_panel(quit)').  This has been started (see
DeviseKey.h, DeviseKeyBinding.[hC], XWindowRep.c, MapIntToInt.[hC])
but needs some work to get all of the functionality described here.
The system independent keycodes are complete for keystrokes, but not
for mouse input (which I was hoping could be defined with the same
mechanism as the keyboard, but there are some issues - eg. a 'mouse
press' event is actually two window events, but to the user its one
event marked with a 'begin event' and 'end event'). (kb 8/2/96)

Highlight record link - A record link that instead of selecting only
matching records, it highlights the records.  That is, when you
select some records in the master view, it doesn't zoom in, it
just highlights the records, and then the matching records in the
slave views get highlighted as well.  (With this type of link, there
doesn't have to be a master and slave, they could be peers.)  The
match should be on any field, including record id. (kb 8/2/96)

Cursor zoom - define two modes for zooming on a cursor view.  The first
is the standard zoom that we all know and love.  The second type of zoom
doesn't affect the cursor, but rather, it performs a zoom in or out on
the other (source) view.  (kb 8/2/96)

Make the open-file dialog box remember its last directory for each
type of file.  Eg, there could be an SelectSession proc and an
SelectDataSource proc that set the current directory to whatever
the user had used the previous time.  (kb 8/2/96)

Configurable zoom magnification - Action.[ch] now has configurable
magnification of zoom in/out, but there is no way for the user to set
it.  An API command and some tcl interface needs to be created.  Also,
the mag level is only for 2d plots right now, it needs to be extended
to 3d.  On a related note, should a ViewGraph have an Action as a
member function, or should there just be one global Action?  (kb 8/3/96)

A tcl slider mechanism for zooming in/out. (kb 8/3/96)

A mini-control panel that uses minimal space, easy access to common
functions, and stays on top of all other windows.

Zoom/New data view locks - some mechanism (see Action.c) in now in
place to lock corners or widths of a view.  When a corner is locked,
zooming will not affect that corner.  An API command needs to be
created for setting locks programmatically.  When new data arrives, it
should also respect the locks (that's why there are 'width' locks).
Need support for 3d. (kb 8/3/96)

Figure out why TkControlPanel::Raise() doesn't quite work right. The
control panel gets raised, but it doesn't redraw itself until it
receives some events - and even then there is about a 3 second delay.
It might just be a tk/fvwm problem - maybe a later version of tk will
fix it. (kb 8/4/96)

Make a "slim" or "light" version of Devise with some stuff stripped out.

Handle images in data better (don't treat them as strings).  (rkw 8/29/96)

Add "shape format" so that shapes can be described in many ways, eg
a rectangle could be described by (lower-left & upper-right) or 
(upper-right & height & width).  (kb 9/3/96)

Alter record query to be aware of the shape's size, eg, you can click
anywhere on a rectangle rather than its center.   (kb/jm 9/3/96)

Rename WindowRep::FillRect* to DrawRect* since the rectangle drawn
is not always filled.  (kb 9/3/96)

Support for custom fill bitmaps and/or user defined fill palette (kb 9/5/96)

Put 3-D borders around views. (ml/rkw/9/6/96)

Allow active Devise windows in other documents (specify a window that
becomes the parent of all Devise windows). (rr/rkw 9/12/96)

Change name of 'Shape' in GData mapping GUI. (rr/rkw/ 9/12/96)

Add a "wiggly line" drawing function in the WindowRep classes. (na/rkw 9/20/96)

Display session name somewhere. (rkw 9/26/96)

Combine TDataAscii and TDataBinary. (rkw/jpm 10/3/96)

Have Devise itself, attrproj, and devread all use the same ParseCat
code. (rkw 10/10/96)

Add text extents function (returning size in what units?) to WindowRep
and its subclasses (something like AbsoluteTextExtents()). (at/rkw 10/11/96)

Add handling of enter/leave events to WindowRepCallback class.
(at/rkw 10/11/96)

Be able to add notations to views and/or data. (rkw/ff 10/14/96)

Possibly allow dumping of the values corresponding to a particular view,
so that they could be imported into other software.  (rkw/tom keating
10/15/96)

Have control of image contrast, etc., in Devise. (rkw/tom keating 10/15/96)

Add a command-line flag that suppresses the generation of derived TDatas
(statistics).  (rkw/gc/ml 10/16/96)

Allow environment variables in paths in the data stream catalog.
(rkw 10/17/96)

Possibly allow each user to have their own composite.ini file. (rkw 10/29/96)

Add documentation on date attribute format and related composite parsers
to the user manual. (rkw 10/29/96)

Add GUI to easily be able to tell which data source(s) are in a particular
view. (rkw 11/11/96)

Allow user to add new colors to the "Color Chooser".  Have sliders or
something similar to set the RGB values. (ml/rkw 11/11/96)

Add a color palette to the mapping to allow flexibility in mapping TData
values to colors (e.g., maybe you want value 1 to be color 10, value 2
to be color 5, etc.). (ml/rkw 11/11/96)

Add a "pattern chooser" similar to the "color chooser".  Then be able to
change the number to pattern correspondence in the mapping (similar to
what we want to do with the colors).  (ml/rkw 11/12/96)

When importing a data source, the GUI should allow you a "sneak peek"
at the first ~10 lines of the data. (ml/rkw 11/12/96)

When creating or editing a schema, you should be able to look at the
first ~10 lines of a corresponding data file. (ml/rkw 11/12/96)

Switch positions of 'hi' and 'lo' in schema editor. (ml/rkw 11/12/96)

Be able to set view foreground and background colors in the mapping
window. (ml/rkw 11/12/96)

Upgrades to PostScript output (see graphics/PostScript.doc). (rkw 11/13/96)

Try to eliminate all references to the 'LocalColor' type outside of the
X-specific code. (rkw 11/19/96)

If query window is open, it should be updated as you change other things.
(ml/rkw 11/20/96)

RecId should be in the TData attribute lists so you can find the min and
max (needed if RecId is mapped to X, Y, or Z in GData). (kb/rkw 11/25/96)

Have a 'reload' menu selection that closes and re-opens the current
session, eliminating all caching, etc. (ml/rkw 12/03/96)

Be able to deal with non-numerical axis values (for example, map a string
attribute to the Y axis, where the strings are just categories, and a
numerical value associated with them would be meaningless).  Or use
numerical values, but be able to put text labels instead of numerical
labels on the axis. (ds/rkw 12/09/96).

Be able to position rectangles by a corner rather than by the center
(ds/rkw 12/09/96).

Have a command to invalidate all TData for a particular file, force
rebuild of indices, etc. (to allow changing data in a view while the
view is open).  (ds/rkw 12/09/96).

Put info about batch and client/server modes in the user documentation.
(rkw 12/09/96)

Perhaps allow colors for data to be specified by RGB value (have RGB
value in a data attribute). (jpm/rkw 12/12/96)

Allow data from stdin to be used (maybe stick it into a buffer DataSource).
(ml/jpm/rkw 12/12/96)

Possibly allow the aspect ratio of a RectX to be fixed. (jpm/ml 12/16/96)

Be able to remove data streams from the 'Define Data Stream' window. (ml/
rkw 12/16/96)

Remove merged views (from API and View classes) (kb 12/18/96)

Be able to run in batch mode without having to connect to an X server.
(rkw 12/23/96)

Have a button in the user interface that forces a refresh of all views.
(ml/rkw 12/23/96)

Knowledge about how piled views work should be removed from code other
than the View class.  For example, take a look at the places in the code
that call IsInPileMode().  (rkw 1/8/97)

The software should deal better with zooming in on a small part of a
Tasvir image (somehow request Tasvir to draw only the visible portion of
the image, rather than asking for a huge image size as it does now).
(rkw 1/9/97)

Put sessions into the Devise catalog. [rr/rkw 1/14/97]

Perhaps add 'Edit' and 'Close' buttons to the 'Active Tables' dialog.
(rkw 1/15/97)

The Help demo needs to actually do something.  (rkw 1/22/97)

Improve record/RID links to allow two master views linking to one slave view,
allowing union, intersection, etc., rather than just union as there is now.
(rr/rkw 1/29/97)

Generalize RID links to record links on any attribute. (rr/rkw 1/29/97)

1/29/97)

Transition user manual from TeX/PostScript to html. (rr/rkw 1/29/97)

Add a new rectangular shape type whose location is specified by the
lower left corner rather than the center. (ml/rkw 1/29/97)

Allow dotted/dashed lines in Devise. (ma/rkw 2/3/97)

Allow user to change window names (really titles). (ma/rkw 2/4/97)

Allow access to Qclic browser functions on Tasvir images.  (rr/ml/rkw 2/5/97)

Allow adding a legend to piled views to distinguish the various traces.
(ma/rkw 2/14/97)

Default view title should always be 'attr1 vs. attr2', not the data stream
name. (ma/rkw 2/14/97)

If you press the 'Stop' button, the system should give some kind of
visual indication that the graphics you see do not represent all of
the data. (ml?/rkw 2/17/97)

The view list in 'Bring View Back' should indicate which views are not
currently displayed in a window. (rkw 2/17/97)

There should be something like a 'go to' button in the Query History window,
that would let you select and execute a particular query. (rr/rkw 3/14/97)

Allow larger sizes for fonts in text labels. (ml/rkw 3/18/97)

Improve user interface for selecting font properties for text labels.
(ml/rkw 3/18/97)

Allow direct importing of GData files. (ml/rkw 4/4/97)

When you bring up the "expression editor" from the mapping window, the
buttons in the mapping window itself should be disabled (and there are
probably other similar situations in other parts of the GUI). (ml/rkw
4/14/97)

Allow labels on axes. (ma/rkw 4/16/97)

Session files should save whether each window is iconified or not, and
they should come back in that state when you open the session file.
(bb/rkw 4/16/97)

Fields that are in the physical schema but not the logical schema should
not be decoded when data is read. (ml/rkw 4/18/97)

Allow a string in a Devise physical schema to be specified as length
0; if this is done, don't hash the string, just stick in zero for
the hash key. (ml/rkw 4/18/97)

Add an 'Apply' button to the Expression dialog in the mapping dialog.
(ml/rkw 5/6/97)

Add a cursor info dialog like the link info dialog. (rkw 5/21/97)

If images are less than a certain number of pixels in size, just draw
them as boxes and don't have Tasvir do anything. (ml/rkw 5/30/97).

Allow user to select in mapping what the meaning is of X, Y, Z for
a given shape (center, lower left, upper right, etc.). (ml/rkw 6/13/97)

Links with offsets. (ml/rkw 7/28/97)

When switching TData or opening a session as a template, the data source
GUI should show only TDatas of the correct type. (rkw 7/28/97)

Have some kind of automatic schema generation based on a "guess" from
reading the first, say, 100 lines of the data. (rkw/ml 7/28/97)

We need to have propagating and non-propagating redraws (for views with
links, especially record links).  For example, if a view gets re-drawn
because its window got resized by the user, the redraw shouldn't get
propagated to other views it links to. (ml/rkw 7/29/97)

There seem to be many copies of the VisualFilter for a given view -- this
should be changed so that there is only one. (rkw 7/31/97)

Allow multiple clients to connect to a single Devise server simultaneously.
(rkw/dk 8/19/97)

Implement a shape like a Rect or RectX, but with the size specified in
pixels rather than user coordinates. (dk/rkw 9/30/97)

Allow port number server listens on to be specified on command line of
devised, devisec, and deviseb. (ma/rkw 11/24/97)

Query dialog should have 'Forward', 'Back' buttons like web browsers
instead of 'Back One' that just does 'do, undo'. (rkw 11/25/97)

Data source definition dialog should have a button that brings up the
schema definition dialog. (ml 11/25/97)

Deal better with views that are removed from a window but not destroyed:
either don't create them when you open a session, or ask the user whether
to save them when they save a session. (td/rkw 12/4/97)

Remove timers and incorporate similar functionality into the dispatcher
to prevent interrupted system calls. (devel 12/4/97)

Get color back into Tcl/Tk windows. (devel 12/4/97)

Have separate templates.c files for each library. (devel 12/4/97)

Clean up the Devise startup scripts -- perhaps get rid of environment
variables, and use configuration files; perhaps split up the scripts
into one determining which program is run and another determining
which sessions, catalog, etc., are used. (devel 12/4/97)

Eliminate streaming buffer manager code or get it working. (rkw/kb 12/8/97)

If possible, use new expression interpreting code (or extend it) to allow
the mappings needed for the PVM session to be interpreted (enabling us to
eliminate the 'multi' form of DEVise). (rr/rkw 12/6/97)

Possibly eliminate crsp, compustat, etc. (devel 12/11/97)

Build and release only the client/server form of DEVise. (devel 12/11/97)
(Depends on being able to get rid of multi.)

Add info to the user manual about expressions in mappings. (rkw 1/13/98)

UniData should have the option to treat \<delimiter> as an occurrance of
the character <delimiter> within a field, as opposed to treating it as
a field delimiter. (rkw/ad 1/28/98)

Convert all file-related system calls (lseek, etc.) to 64-bit versions.
(kb/rkw 1/29/98)

Perhaps have a command to allow a client to prevent other clients from
connecting to the server while that client is connected. (rkw 1/29/98)

Get rid of special "multi" version of DEVise -- make improvements to
expressions, etc., if necessary to do what we need with the regular
version of DEVise. (rkw, et al 2/5/98)

Get rid of composite parsers (make sure UniData can handle all necessary
cases). (rkw, et al 2/5/98)

Build DEVise for Solaris with threads so we don't have to use semaphores.
(rkw, et al 2/5/98)

Possibly add record id to GData sent to socket or file. (rkw 2/10/98)

Possibly add view name to GData sent to socket or file. (rkw 2/10/98)

Replace EmbeddedTk symbols with Java symbols. (ml/rkw 2/11/98)

Have GUI to rename schemas. (ag/rkw 2/16/98)

Allow log-scale axes. (ag/rkw 2/16/98)

templates.C (in src/utils) should be split up so that we only grab the
template instantiations we need for libdevwin, etc. (rkw 2/17/98)

Allow LoadStringSpace to accept a URL as a file name. (am/rkw 2/27/98)

Add a method to the Shape classes that returns the bounding box (or
bounding prism) of a given symbol; use it in testing against the
visual filter, doing count mappings, etc. (ml/rkw 3/23/98)

Allow the user to select whether symbols that overlap the visual
filter, but whose reference point is outside the visual filter,
should be displayed. (ml/rkw 3/23/98)

Have GUI to automatically bring up the data source definition editor
(in read-only mode?) on the data source in the selected view. (rkw 3/30/98)

There should be a way to expand and contract the size of a cursor in its
destination view (the view the cursor is drawn in). (rkw 5/22/98)

Allow the user to specify which keys cause which actions (zoom, home, etc.).
(rr/rkw 6/28/98)

Possibly have the DataReader output tuples in the same format that the DTE
uses internally, to avoid an extra conversion step. (kb/rkw 10/13/98)

Move UNIXFILES underneath the DTE or dump them. (rr/rkw 10/13/98)

Possibly change the record link creation code (in VisualLinkClassInfo) to
actually implement record links as set links (can't be done if UNIXFILES
are still outside the DTE). (rr/rkw 10/13/98)

Eliminate Jussi's buffer manager from DEVise. (rr/rkw 10/13/98)

The JavaScreen needs to allow dragging and resizing windows, and sending
them to the back and bringing them to the front. (rr/rkw 10/13/98)

Possibly don't allow a single mapping to be inserted into more than one
view (force one-to-one correspondence between views and mappings).
(rkw 10/28/98)

Add info to user manual about how to create 3D views. (qh/rkw 10/30/98)

JavaScreen should allow user to look at mappings (read-only). (rr/rkw 3/31/99)

JavaScreen should have a help button that lists key shortcuts. (rr/rkw 3/31/99)

Java buttons in JavaScreen (i.e., search engine demo) shouldn't create a
new Netscape window each time they're clicked. (rr/rkw 3/31/99)


COMPLETED
---------
GUI improvements to make sessions easier to understand:
- Mapping should show data source name.
- Display a table of all links, of the following form, sorted by link name:

without closing the dialog.  (kb 8/2/96)

Get PostScript output of full screen working. (ml/rkw 2/19/97)

Add a note to the user manual more clearly specifying the difference
