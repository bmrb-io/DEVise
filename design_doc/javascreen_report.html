<a name="Overview"><h1>Overview</h1></a>
The JavaScreen is a simplified DEVise client, implemented in Java, that can
be downloaded and run through a web browser.

<p>The main purpose of the JavaScreen is to allow people to easily try out
DEVise and get an idea how it works, without having to download and install
the full DEVise software.  The JavaScreen is also a first step towards
replacing the existing Tcl/Tk DEVise GUI.


<a name="Capabilities"><h1>Capabilities</h1></a>

<p>At the present time, the JavaScreen has only "session exploration"
capabilities as opposed to "session creation" or "session editing"
capabilities.  The JavaScreen can zoom, pan, move cursors, and so on,
but cannot edit mappings, create or destroy windows or views, edit the
data source catalog, or change the appearance of a session.

<p>It would not be hard to add server support for full range of DEVise
capabilities, since these capabilities are already supported for the
"regular" client (the devisec).  The main issues would be whether we
want to spend the effort to implement these capabilities in the Java
code, and how doing so would affect the size of the class files, and,
therefore, the time to download the JavaScreen.

<p>It is important to note that the JavaScreen does not really "understand"
DEVise sessions; for example, the JavaScreen code doesn't have any knowledge
of DEVise links built into it.  Basically, when the user performs some
action, the JavaScreen sends a command describing that action to the
DEVise server; the server determines what needs to be done as the result
of that action and sends appropriate commands and image data to the
JavaScreen.


<a name="Other Software"><h1>Relationship to Other DEVise Software</h1></a>

<p>Prior to the implementation of the JavaScreen, two DEVise clients already
existed -- the devisec and deviseb.  Both of these clients send commands
to the DEVise server, and receive replies, over a command socket (as the
JavaScreen does).  There are two major conceptual differences between the
JavaScreen and the other DEVise clients:
<ul>
<li>The JavaScreen may not have access to the same files that the server
does; the devisec and deviseb are written with the assumption that the
client and the server <i>do</i> have access to the same files.</li>
<li>The JavaScreen must display images within its window; the devisec and
deviseb are not involved at all in the display of data -- the server
creates its own window(s) and displays the data in them.</li>
</ul>


<a name="Startup"><h1>Startup</h1></a>

<p> A JavaScreen is started by the user viewing the appropriate web page.
When the JavaScreen starts up, it attempts to connect to the "jspop"
(JavaScreen Point Of Presence) on the web server machine.  The jspop
listens on a specified port for connections from JavaScreens.

<p>The jspop (which is always running on the web server) starts up one
or more DEVise servers when it is started.  When a JavaScreen connects
to the jspop, the jspop makes a corresponding connection to a DEVise
server.

<p>The jspop can kill and restart DEVise servers if necessary.


<a name="Communication"><h1>Communication</h1></a>

<p>Communication between the JavaScreen and the DEVise server takes place
on two sockets, the command socket and the image socket.  The JavaScreen
sends commands on the command socket.  The DEVise server sends command
results, and commands of its own, on the command socket.  The server sends
image data on the image socket.

<p>All communication between the JavaScreen and the DEVise server goes
through the jspop.  There are several reasons for this:
<ul>
<li>It allows for the possibility of running several DEVise servers on several
different machines.  If the JavaScreen and the DEVise server communicated
directly, the DEVise server would have to run on the web server machine
because of Java's security restrictions.</li>
<li>It makes it easier for the jspop to perform <a href="#Switching">client switching</a>.</li>
<li>It allows the jspop to check for problems such as the DEVise server
not responding to a command.</li>
</ul>


<a name="Switching"><h1>Client Switching</h1></a>

<p>One of the major limitations of the DEVise server is that it can only
handle one client at a time (there can actually be multiple clients, but
all of the clients act on the same session, which is not what we want in
this case).  The main reason for this restriction is that many of the
data structures in the server are built on the assumption that the server
will only have one session open at a time; it is not really a limitation
of the communications parts of the software.

<p>Because of this limitation, the jspop supports multiple clients by
the process of "client switching".  This means that when a new JavaScreen
starts up and no server is available, the jspop will instruct a server to
save its state, close the session, disconnect from its current client,
and connect to the new client.  When the user of the first client performs
some action, the jspop will instruct the server to save the state for the
new client, and restore the state saved for the first client.  Client
switching involves a significant degree of overhead (the exact amount
depends largely on the complexity and data size of the session being
restored).


<a name="Server Support"><h1>Server Support</h1></a>

<p>The DEVise server was extended to provide support for the following
JavaScreen functions:
<ul>
<li>Sending lists of session files to the JavaScreen.</li>
<li>Extension of session files to fully save the DEVise state.</li>
<li>Sending GIFs to the JavaScreen.</li>
<li>Keeping track of which windows have become "dirty" since the last
time their GIF was sent.</li>
<li>Improvements to the "wait for queries" function.</li>
<li>Rubberband lines in the JavaScreen.</li>
<li>Drill-down (point queries) in the JavaScreen.</li>
<li>Key actions in the JavaScreen.</li>
<li>Allowing the JavaScreen to set the virtual display size.</li>
<li>Having cursors drawn by the JavaScreen, rather than by the server.</li>
<li>Allowing Tasvir to draw into pixmaps.</li>
<li>Sending a view's GData on the image socket.</li>
<li>Decreasing DEVise server memory usage.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Session File Lists</h3>
<p>Because it is assumed to have access to the same files as the server,
the devisec client presents a list of available session files by directly
examining the appropriate directory.  Because this is obviously not possible
for the JavaScreen, a new command to send a list of available session files
was added to the DEVise server.

<p>Since the session file directories can include subdirectories, provision
for this was added to the JavaScreen support.  When the user selects a
file or directory in the JavaScreen, this information is sent to the
DEVise server.  The server determines whether the name it is sent is a file
or a directory.  If it is a file, the server attempts to open the file as
a DEVise session.  If the name is a directory, it reads the contents of
the directory and sends a new list of files to the JavaScreen.

<h3>Saving State</h3>
<p>In the course of testing <a href="#Switching">client switching</a>, it
was found that DEVise session files did not totally save the server state,
in that they did not save which view was selected.  Therefore, an option
was added to allow saving this information, and it is saved whenever the
server saves a session file as the result of a client switch.

<h3>Sending GIFs</h3>
<p>Because the JavaScreen must display all images in its own window, the
images must somehow be sent to the JavaScreen, rather than simply being
painted in an X window as is done with the "regular" client.  Since the
DEVise server already had the capability to dump windows to GIF files,
this capability was simply extended to send the GIF file over the image
socket to the JavaScreen (deleting the file after sending it).

<p>At the present time, GIFs are sent on a per-window basis, but this
is being changed to a per-view basis.


<h3>"Dirty" Windows</h3>
<p>In the earliest version of support for the JavaScreen, any change to a
window simply resulted in the GIFs for all windows being generated and sent,
even if some of the windows had not changed.  To avoid sending GIFs for
windows that had not changed, a "dirty window" flag was implemented.  This
is simply a flag in each window that is set when anything is painted in the
window, and cleared when the window is dumped as a GIF.

<p>To go along with the change of sending separate GIFs for each view, the
"dirty" flags are being changed to a per-view basis, as well.  This will,
in some cases, further reduce the amount of image data that needs to be
sent as the result of a user action.


<h3>Waiting for Queries</h3>
<p>Because the Dispatcher in DEVise essentially simulates threads, a
command that causes views to change generally returns control to the client
before the appropriate windows have been repainted.  For the devisec client,
this doesn't really matter in most cases, because the server continues to
paint the windows even after the command has returned to the client (there
are a few special cases where this caused problems).  Because of the
special cases, a 'wait for queries' command was implemented that does not
return control until all pending queries are finished.

<p>For the JavaScreen, however, the 'wait for queries' command is employed
every time any views may be changed, since the server must not generate
GIFs until the appropriate windows have been fully painted (the GIFs are
generated by dumping the pixels from the appropriate window or pixmap).
This heavy use of 'wait for queries' exposed some problems with the original
implementation, necessitating improvements to that command.

<h3>Rubberband Lines</h3>
<p>The user can draw a rubberband line in a DEVise view by dragging the
mouse with the left button held down.  This results in that view zooming
to display only the area within the rubberband line.

<p>The "regular" (devisec) client is not involved at all in the process of
drawing rubberband lines and zooming as a result (since the mouse events
are happening in windows "owned" by the server).  On the other hand, when
the user drags to create a rubberband line in the JavaScreen, the events
are occurring in the JavaScreen's window.  The rubberband line is actually
drawn by the JavaScreen itself, and there is no communication with the
server until the user releases the mouse button at the end of the operation.
Then the JavaScreen sends the coordinates of the mouse movement (in pixels,
relative to the origin of the GIF) to the server.  The server then
calculates the zoom that is necessary, and sends the updated GIFs to the
JavaScreen.  A new command was added to the DEVise server to handle
rubberband lines originating from the JavaScreen.

<h3>Drill-Down</h3>
<p>Users can "drill down" (issue a point query) by holding down the middle
mouse button in "regular" DEVise.  They can do the same thing in the
JavaScreen by double-clicking the left mouse button.  This causes the
TData records (if any) at the mouse location to be displayed.

<p>Again, the "regular" devisec is not involved in the drill-down process.
In the JavaScreen, when the user double-clicks, the JavaScreen sends a
message with the location of the double-click to the server, and the server
sends back the relevant TData records (if any).  The JavaScreen then creates
a popup window in which to display these records.  A new command was added
to the DEVise server to handle point queries originating from the
JavaScreen.

<h3>Key Actions</h3>
<p>Users can perform a number of actions such as panning, zooming, and so
on, by clicking a key while the mouse pointer is in a DEVise view.

<p>Once again, the "regular" devisec is not involved in these actions, but
the JavaScreen is.  A new command was added to the DEVise server to
handle key actions originating from the JavaScreen.

<h3>Virtual Display Size</h3>
<p>The size and location of DEVise windows are defined as a fraction of the
display size, so that a given session will look essentially the same on
displays with different resolutions.  Because the JavaScreen cannot use
the full display, and it is likely to be running on a different display
than the server is, the JavaScreen sets the display size to the size of
the window in which it will display all of the DEVise data.  This allows
the server to create GIFs of the proper size to fit into the JavaScreen's
window the same way they would into the entire display if the session were
run with the "regular" DEVise.  A new command was added to the DEVise
server to allow the JavaScreen to set the virtual display size.

<h3>Cursor Drawing</h3>
<p>In order to reduce the amount of image data that must be sent, cursors
are drawn by the JavaScreen, rather than by the server (in all cases except
the JavaScreen, cursors are drawn by the server).

<p>Several changes to the server were needed to implement this:
<ul>
<li>First, actual drawing of the cursors is disabled in the server when
the JavaScreen opens a session.</li>
<li>Second, commands were implemented that tell the JavaScreen to draw and
erase cursors.  The 'draw cursor' command basically tells the JavaScreen to
draw a rectangle at a certain size and location, since the JavaScreen does
not really "understand" cursors.</li>
<li>Third, provision was needed to make sure that the 'draw cursor' commands
are sent only <i>after</i> the appropriate GIFs have been sent to the
JavaScreen.  This is done by keeping a list of all cursors that would be
drawn as the window(s) are painted; then, after the GIFs have been sent, the
list of cursors to draw is sent.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tasvir</h3>
<p>When the JavaScreen connects to a DEVise server, the server runs in
"batch" mode.  This means that it creates pixmaps rather than actual X
windows.  DEVise uses a separate program called Tasvir to display images
such as JPEGs within DEVise views.  Originally, Tasvir did not work on
pixmaps, meaning that views containing JPEGs were not displayed correctly
in the JavaScreen.  To fix this problem, Tasvir was modified so that it
can display images in pixmaps.

<h3>Sending GData</h3>
<p>The capability to save a view's GData to a file was already in place
before the JavaScreen was implemented.  In order to support applications
such as the search engine demo session, this capability was extended to
allow sending GData over the image socket to the JavaScreen.  In the case
of the search engine demo, the JavaScreen uses the GData to create buttons
that replicate the functionality of buttons created with Tk in the "regular"
version of DEVise.

<p>The session file must specify views for which GData is to be sent to
the JavaScreen.  (So far this has been done by hand-editing a "wrapper"
around the actual session file.  The "wrapper" file just opens the session
and sets the appropriate views to send GData.)  The DEVise server still
sends the "blank" GIF for GData views, so that the background color,
axes (if drawn), etc., are correct.

<h3>Memory Usage</h3>
<p>Because of the one-client-per-server limitation, it is desirable to run
as many DEVise servers as possible, so that multiple clients can be served
without incurring the overhead of frequent client switching.  At this time,
the biggest limitation on running multiple servers is the amount of resources,
particularly memory, consumed by the DEVise servers.  To improve this
situation, the amount of memory used by the DEVise server has been
significantly reduced, hopefully with more improvements still to come.


<a name="Other Changes"><h1>Other Server Changes</h1></a>
<p>There are two other important changes to the DEVise server that were not
made solely because of the JavaScreen, but are necessary for its support:
<ul>
<li>Opening and saving session files on the server side.</li>
<li>Extension of Command Usage</li>
</ul>

<h3>Opening and Saving Session Files</h3>
<p>DEVise session files consist of a list of commands, executed sequentially.
Earlier versions contained Tcl control structures, such as 'ifs', and
therefore need a Tcl interpreter to be opened.  Originally, session files
were opened by using the Tcl interpreter that already existed in the client.
Session files were also saved by Tcl code in the client.  This was changed
in version 1.4 -- both the opening and saving of session files was moved
to the server.

<h3>Extension of Command Usage</h3>
<p>In order for DEVise collaboration to work properly, a number of actions
that previously did not involve the actual issuing of a DEVise command
were changed to issue a command (key actions and rubberband lines, for
example).  This made the implementation of the corresponding JavaScreen
support easier (and also helps in debugging).

<a name="Future"><h1>Future Work</h1></a>

Possible future work on the JavaScreen and JavaScreen support includes:
<ul>
<li>Improving the robustness of the software, particularly in terms of
the installation on the web server machine.</li>
<li>Consolidating the command and image sockets into a single socket
to simplify the jspop.</li>
<li>Further decreases in the memory usage of the DEVise server.</li>
<li>Adding more capabilities to the JavaScreen user interface.</li>
</ul>
