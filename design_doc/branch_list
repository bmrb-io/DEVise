		List of Existing DEVise Code Branches in CVS

Note that branches marked with <branch name>_end are no longer active.
They've (normally) been merged back into the trunk, or else abandoned.

== Top-level branches:

* js_vis_filter_dialog_br:  Very minor steps towards having a dialog
in the JavaScreen to set the visual filter of a view.

* x86_64_centos5_br:  This has mostly been merged.  There are minor
unmerged changes; I'm not sure if they're important at all.

* bug949_br:  Some work on implementing this (multiple levels of
parent/child views in the JavaScreen).  This is a pretty major change,
so I don't think there's any point in pursuing it if the JavaScreen
is not the major focus of BMRB's new visualization development.

* restraints_in_jmol_br:  Has a few very old changes.  I think these
can be ignored, since the restraint visualizations have been implemented.

* V1_8b0_br:  Most changes have been merged; unmerged changes are very
minor config changes and can be ignored.

* V2_1b4_br:  This has quite extensive changes, but I think they're
all very old.  This was a branch for low-priority new features that were
being worked on separately from higher-priority things.

* reproduce_bug831_br:  This has one small change, which was never
merged.  But the bug was eventually fixed (seperately from this branch,
I guess) so I think the branch can be ignored.

* gcc_303_br:  A bunch of unmerged changes, but they can be safely
ignored since we long ago passed that version of gcc!

* collab_cleanup_br
* js_no_reconnect_br
* bmrb_dist_br
* no_collab_br
* new_viewsyms_br
* js_viewsyms_br
* newpile_br
* projection_push_br
* double_br
* collab_debug_br
* collab_br
* expression_br
* cleanup_1_4_7_br

* andyd_gui_br
* js_restraint_prod_br
* jspop_debug_0405_br

== Peptide-CGI-only branches:

* s2d_multi_models_br:  Started on display of coordinates for multiple
models; nothing functional yet.

* s2d_new_vis_serv_csr_br:  Minor changes.  I think this branch can be
ignored.

* multiple_entities_br:  Only changes to test_all and dummy_csr_server.
