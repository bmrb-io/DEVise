		To-do 09.049:  JavaScreen Feedback GUI
				2015-07-15

We want to have a button in the JavaScreen that brings up an html form
that allows users to easily send us feedback.

When a user does that, I think it should send email, probably to
bmrbhelp@bmrb.wisc.edu.  Either have a form that sends email via a PHP
script on the server, or pop up a mail client automatically.

I also think that it would be a good idea for the JavaScreen to pass
along the file name of the session the user currently has open,
and then the form should automatically include that in the email.

Also, once to-do 09.048 is done, maybe we should save the visualization
state and send *that* session file name, as opposed to the "generic"
session file name.
