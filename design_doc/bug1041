The problem seems to be that the CGI script is getting stuck in the
loop where it's reading the response from the JSPoP.  And it looks
like that's happening because in some cases the JSPoP isn't closing
the socket on its end, so I think the CGI script calls sysread()
and that probably never returns because the socket is open.

Hmm -- show (all) view help and then hide view help seems to cause
problems...
