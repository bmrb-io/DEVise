	To-do 13.012: Convert the JavaScreen to use Java Web Start
				2016-02-23

Right now (2016-02-23) I'm still figuring out the details of how web
start works.  I've been able to run the JavaScreen via web start
from the command line (javaws), but it has been prohibited from
connecting to a web server.  I'm not sure if that's maybe because
so far I've run an application instead of an applet?

I think that, to get things to work in a browser, you need a bit of
Javascript in the "referring" HTML page.  (It doesn't seem to work
to directly point the browser to the JNLP page, unless you've already
gone there from the "referring" HTML page, so I assume the browser
caches the information that it should run Web Start on the JNLP
page.)

Anyhow, assuming I get that to work, my plan is to add a link or
button to the JavaScreen pages that launches the JavaScreen via
Web Start.  (My plan is to, at least initially, leave the existing
applet code in place for browsers that support it.  We could take
that out eventually.)

Note for Peptide-CGI implementation:  Once I figure out the details
of how Web Start works, I'll obviously have to modify the Peptide-CGI
code accordingly, and have it generate .JNLP files corresponding to
the session-specific .HTML files it currently generates
