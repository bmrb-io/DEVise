			DEVise/JavaScreen To-Do List
				$Revision$

TEMPTEMP -- should I break this up into categories? (e.g., JavaScreen,
links, etc.?  what should categories be?) (how would numbering work then?
maybe x.y?)

Possible categories:
JavaScreen, GUI
JavaScreen, communication
JavaScreen, misc.
DEVise, GUI
DEVise, links
DEVise, cursors
DEVise, piles and stacks
DEVise, data sources
DEVise, misc.
Release/distribution

010 09/10/01	OPEN	?	JavaScreen: change some buttons to menus. (rkw)

Allow multiplicative factor (and offset?) for visual links
          (specify for each view).

Have an option to force the session's aspect ratio to be
          preserved in the JavaScreen.

warn when closing session if there are changes other than cursor moves

JavaScreen:Time out and exit on the client side if the user has gone out
          of the appropriate web page for a given amount of time (so we
	            don't have loads of extra JS clients in the browser).

JavaScreen: Allow multiple levels of child views.

?combine bin_arch and dyn_lib_arch in release/distribution??

Change the JSPoP so that collaboration clients have a DEViseClient object.

JavaScreen: initiate collaboration with explicit commands, not reconnection
with "magic" flag values.

JavaScreen: need to clean up temporary session files

Allow XY cursor with bottom anchored at 0 (rkw 11/20/01)

JS communications protocols should probably have different versions in
each direction. (rkw 11/30/01)

Should API_CMD, etc., have "unusual" values, so other things are not so
easily confused with them? Also, always check for a valid value when
receiving a command? (rkw 11/14/00)

The JavaScreen should probably quit after it gets a certain number of
socket write errors. (rkw 11/14/00)

The JavaScreen should have an option to display the Y value of the bar
the mouse is on, rather than the actual Y location of the mouse, as
the mouse location. (jm/rkw 12/19/01)

The print dialog should remember previous values. (gk/rkw 10/1/02)

When printing to GIFs, we should either deal correctly with parts
of windows being obscured, or at least warn the user that they should
raise all of the windows before printing. (rkw 10/1/02)
