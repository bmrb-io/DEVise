			DEVise/JavaScreen To-Do List
				$Revision$

TEMPTEMP -- should I break this up into categories? (e.g., JavaScreen,
links, etc.?  what should categories be?) (how would numbering work then?
maybe x.y?)

Possible categories:
JavaScreen, GUI
JavaScreen, communication
JavaScreen, misc.
DEVise, GUI
DEVise, links
DEVise, cursors
DEVise, piles and stacks
DEVise, data sources
DEVise, misc.
Release/distribution

010 09/10/01	OPEN	?	JavaScreen: change some buttons to menus. (rkw)

Allow multiplicative factor (and offset?) for visual links
          (specify for each view).

Have an option to force the session's aspect ratio to be
          preserved in the JavaScreen.

warn when closing session if there are changes other than cursor moves

JavaScreen:Time out and exit on the client side if the user has gone out
          of the appropriate web page for a given amount of time (so we
	            don't have loads of extra JS clients in the browser).

JavaScreen: Allow multiple levels of child views.

?combine bin_arch and dyn_lib_arch in release/distribution??

Change the JSPoP so that collaboration clients have a DEViseClient object.

JavaScreen: initiate collaboration with explicit commands, not reconnection
with "magic" flag values.
