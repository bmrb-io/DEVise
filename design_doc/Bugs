--- --------    ------  -------------------------------------------------------
001 05/14/96	OPEN	There are a number of memory leaks. (rkw)
			(Most of these have been fixed -- at least the big
			ones.  rkw 10/15/96)
			Assigned: Guangshun

002 05/14/96	FIXED	DEVise hogs an awful lot of CPU cycles even when
			you are not doing anything. (rkw/kb) (jpm)

003 05/14/96	FIXED	Numeric keypad keys don't always work correctly
			on Suns running SunOS 4.x. (rkw)

004 05/16/96	FIXED   Physical schema editor does not support the length
			parameter of string attribute types. (jpm)

005 05/16/96	OPEN	Physical schema editor does not support multi-word
			high-low values (e.g. 'Jan 1 1990 00:00:00'). (jpm)
			Deferred

006 05/16/96	OPEN	Date attribute type cannot handle dates before
			Jan 1 1970 (Unix zero time value). (jpm)
			Deferred

007 05/16/96	FIXED	Kiviat graph cannot be destroyed once created.
			Destroying it through the window manager causes
			Devise to crash. (jpm)

008 05/16/96	FIXED	View window cannot be destroyed through the
			window manager causes Devise to crash. (jpm)

009 05/22/96	FIXED	OBJ in generic/Makefile.base doesn't get the
			right list; causes 'make clean' to try to delete
			source files. (rkw)

010 05/31/96	OPEN	In TDataMap.c, call to ConvertToGData with _tmpPtr
			as argument may not be work correctly (alignment of
			_tmpPtr). (rkw)
			Deferred

011 06/06/96	CD	DEVise doesn't deal well with bar charts where data
			is all zeros -- sometimes crashes. (rkw)

012 06/06/96	OPEN	All TData's ever used in a session get saved, even
			if they're no longer used. (rkw)
			Deferred

013 07/10/96	FIXED	Schema editing code doesn't seem to recognize comment
			lines in the schema files -- tries to interpret them
			as attributes. (rkw)

014 07/11/96	FIXED   Schema editor doesn't allow entry of string lengths
			(always forces them to 10). (rkw) (duplicate of 004)

015 07/11/96	FIXED	HP version of Devise can't open the condorview1.tk
			session. (rkw)

016 07/31/96	OPEN	Catalog system is type unsafe. (kb/rkw)
			Deferred

017 08/05/96	FIXED	Numeric keypad keys now work only if num lock is
			off. (rkw)

018 08/05/96	FIXED	Data segment stuff is broken. (rkw)

019 08/05/96	CD	demo/COD1.tk core dumps (at least on HPs). (rkw)

020 08/05/96	FIXED	Numeric keypad keys only work in solaris version? (rkw)

021 08/05/96	FIXED	'5' key doesn't work. (rkw)

022 08/06/96	FIXED?	Records missing from view when many views or 
			datasources are open. (kb)

023 08/04/96	FIXED	Doing an extreme zoom in causes extra records to 
			suddenly appear. (kb)
			9/6/96: cause of problem found:
			Overflow problem when converting from devise
			coordinates (double) to X coordinates (short).
			See XWindowRep::FillRectArray for one possible
			solution which works for rectangles, but it won't
			quite right work for other types (eg lines).
			(Possible fix by rkw, 11/12/99 -- see
			XWindowRep::Line().)
			(Better fix by wenger, 1/3/05.)

024 08/06/96	OPEN	Zooming as far as you can in or out can cause 
			DEVise to fail an assertion. (kb)
			Deferred

025 08/07/96	OPEN	Keypad '5' doesn't work when num lock is off. (rkw)
			Deferred

026 08/07/96	OPEN	On HP and SPARC/SunOS, keypad keys only work when
			num lock is on. (rkw)
			Deferred

027 08/09/96	FIXED	Load demo/colors.tk, scroll; load demo/3d_test.tk,
			scroll -> core dump (only on SPARC/Solaris?). (rkw)

028 08/12/96	FIXED	Overlays don't work (see LandsEnd/a2.tk). (ml/rkw)

029 08/13/96	FIXED	Splitting and re-merging views corrupts data. (rkw)

030 08/13/96	FIXED	A view continuously redraws itself while it's
			iconified. (rkw)

031 08/15/96	FIXED	Rotation of stacked views doesn't seem to work. (rkw)

032 08/15/96	FIXED	After removing a view from a window, the remaining
			views aren't redrawn until you click in that window.
			(rkw)

033 08/23/96	FIXED	Run LandsEnd/test.tk -- one view doesn't draw
			correctly (because of links). (ssl/rkw)

034 08/28/96	FIXED	Run Dali1.tk without specifying Dali server ->
			core dump. (kb/rkw)

035 08/29/96	OPEN	Files in temp and work directories don't get
			cleaned up. (ssl/rkw)
			(Actually, the temp directory gets cleaned up if
			Devise exits normally.) (rkw 8/30/96)
			Deferred

036 08/30/96	FIXED	Run LandsEnd/a2.tk session with client/server
			Devise -> crashes (assertion fails in View.c). (rkw)

037 09/04/96	FIXED	Set X in mapping to a constant -> core dump. (rkw)

038 09/05/96	FIXED	'Not Supported Yet' window needs an 'OK' button.
			(rkw)

039 09/12/96	FIXED	+/- keys don't change symbol sizes. (ml/rkw)

040 09/13/96	FIXED	+/- keys seem to only work on one view of piled/
			stacked views (see LandsEnd/a2.tk). (rkw)
			Deferred

041 09/16/96	FIXED	If you change the X mapping between a date attribute
			and an attribute of another type, the axis labels
			aren't correctly updated until the session is saved
			and re-opened. (rkw)
			Fixed by RKW, 1998-12-22.

042 09/19/96	FIXED	Devise doesn't complain if you give an illegal
			command line option. (rkw)

043 09/24/96	FIXED	XWindowRep, PSWindowRep don't always check that they
			aren't overflowing points, rectAngles arrays. (rkw)

044 09/25/96	FIXED	GDataBin objects take way too much memory (256K
			for Connectors). (rkw)

045 10/07/96	FIXED   User can't enter a tab for a separator in the
			schema editing window. (rkw)

046 10/07/96	WORK	Create a window with the same name as a data stream
			-> crash. (rkw)  (This is a consequence of bug 016.)
			(Workaround implemented: ClassDir exits if a duplicate
			name is added. rkw 10/15/96)

047 10/08/96	FIXED	Load /p/devise/wenger/session/hourstats.tk, iconify
			the window -> crash. (rkw)

048 10/09/96	FIXED	Devise core dumps if data file named in catalog
			does not exist. (rkw)

049 10/11/96	OPEN	Load MailOrder/a2_full.tk session -- DEVISE_TMP
			directory gets huge amounts of stuff written to it.
			(Running with '-convert 0' flag prevents this.) (rkw)
			(Also, DEVise eventually crashes if the partition
			gets filled up.)
			Deferred

050 10/14/96	FIXED	Setting a GData attribute to recid does not work
			correctly (if it's already set it's okay, but
			setting it doesn't work). (rkw)

051 10/15/96    FIXED	Showing statistics as text produces many errors. (rkw)

052 10/16/96	FIXED	When importing a data stream (particularly when
			mapping recId to X) xlow sometimes comes up
			greater than xhigh. (rkw)

053 10/21/96	OPEN	You run out of available file descriptors if you
			have too many GDatas. (rkw)
			(Workaround: doesn't open GData files if '-convert 0'
			is specified on the command line.)
			Deferred

054 10/22/96    FIXED   Tcl error when defining visualization on a data
                        file that has one record. Reason: incr does not
                        work on floating-point numbers. (jpm)

055 10/22/96	FIXED	You can't find the name (not title) of a view from
			the GUI. (rkw)

056 10/24/96	OPEN	Too hard to hit the middle of boxes to display
			record data. (rkw)
			Deferred

057 10/24/96	CD	When you switch the layout of a window (e.g., vertical
			to horizontal) the window often is not redrawn. (rkw)

058 10/29/96	FIXED	Changing line width doesn't work in direct PostScript.
			(rkw)

059 11/05/96	OPEN	Keyboard callback function for SGI version of client/
			server library doesn't work. (rkw/na)
			Deferred

060 11/05/96	OPEN	WinServer's HandleButton(..) callback routine
			in client/server library can't handle continuous
			calls (holding down mouse button). (rkw/na)
			Deferred

061 11/11/96    FIXED   GData is never cached in memory! Found bug in
                        TData.h: int RecSize() somehow no longer virtual
                        as it should be. (jpm)

062 11/08/96	FIXED	Don't ask whether you want to close a session when
			there is no session open (e.g., immediately after
			starting devise). (ml/rkw)

063 11/12/96	WORK	Devise core dumps when trying to parse a schema
			with a string attribute that's missing the length.
			(rkw)
			(Workaround: assertion fails.)

064 11/14/96	FIXED	Load session test/miron_new.tk; pile the views in
			DEViseWn1, and flip the pile -> the view is drawn
			only when one of the three views is on top. (ml/
			rkw)

065 11/14/96	CD  	Load session test/dcb1.tk; the data in the 'Log
			Display' window is not drawn, even though a point
			query indicates that the data is there. (rkw/kb)

066 11/14/96	CD	Load session test/dbc1.tk; decrease the size of
			the symbols in the 'RunTime vs. ExecTime' view
			with the '-' key -> symbols change to single pixels
			much too soon. (rkw)

067 11/14/96	CD	Load session test/DBC.tk; in view 'Restarts vs.
			ExecTime', the whole view within the axes is filled
			in with a kind of maroon color. Problem does
                        not seem to exist any longer. (rkw/jpm)

068 11/14/96	FIXED	Exporting a session with data doesn't seem to work
			if there is more than one data source (export
			appears to work, but subsequent open fails).  (See
			session test/miron_new_wdata.tk.) (rkw)

069 11/14/96	OPEN	Load session test/dbc2.tk; most views are initially
			drawn with incorrect colors.  This somehow fixes
			itself if you force a redraw (resize windows, etc.).
			Problem does not seem to exist any longer.  Perhaps
			the saved pixmaps just got goofed up. (rkw/jpm)

070 11/14/96	CD/NB?	Load session test/dbc2.tk; toggling axes does not
			work correctly. Problem does not seem to exist
                        any longer. Perhaps this was not really a problem
                        in the first place? (jpm)
			(See also bug 110.)

071 11/18/96	FIXED	In piled views with axes, the data from non-"top"
			views sometimes overdraws the X axis and is drawn
			to the left of the Y axis. (rkw/jpm)
			(See also bug 098.)

072 11/19/96	FIXED	(With multi) Open test/multidemo2.tk, close it ->
			core dump (at least on HP and SPARC/Solaris). (rkw)

073 11/19/96	FIXED	Hit connector key ('c') on a scatter plot ->
			internal error. (ml/rkw)

074 11/19/96	FIXED	Data in view shouldn't be redrawn when you change
			the view title. (ml/rkw)

075 11/19/96	FIXED	If there's no view title, the Y axis (if any) is
			not displayed correctly. (rkw)

076 11/20/96	OPEN	'Child windows should have been destroyed first' error
			message (don't know exactly how to reproduce this).
			(rr/rkw)
			Deferred

077 11/21/96	FIXED	Importing data into a window with piled views
			doesn't work correctly -- new view gets put into
			window but is not visible unless views are unpiled.
			(rkw)

078 11/21/96	FIXED	Open a template as a session, cancel out of selecting
			a data stream -> some of the (internal) objects for
			the session are not destroyed (opening the same
			session again causes duplicate name error). (rkw)

079 11/21/96	OPEN	Data shouldn't be erased when switching from display
			to layout mode. (ml/rkw)
			Deferred

080 11/21/96	OPEN	'Working' should be shown while drilling down as
			the result of a middle button click. (ml/rkw)
			Deferred

081 11/22/96	FIXED	Derived data histograms not always working (see
			the session test/sales1.tk, must be on tiger to
			use this). (ml/rkw)
			(Histograms not supported on scatter plots yet.)

082 11/25/96	FIXED	Load session test/a2.tk -> core dump. (rkw/jpm)

083 11/25/96	FIXED	Printing directly to a printer doesn't work. (rkw)

084 11/25/96	FIXED	Temporary print file isn't removed after printing.
			(rkw)

085 11/26/96	FIXED	Record links to window with map not working right in
			session test/a2.tk (_all_ records are initially
			drawn; then if you force a redraw, only the correct
			ones are drawn). (rkw)

086 11/27/96	CD	Can't print session wenger/session/PrintTest6.tk
			(never finishes). (rkw)

087 12/02/96	FIXED	Removing a view causes DEVise to exit. (rkw)

088 12/02/96	FIXED	If you click on a view to select it while data is
			being drawn, the XOR'ing of the selection box gets
			goofed up. (ssl/rkw)

089 12/03/96	FIXED	PostScript bounding box does not fit tightly around
			the image. (ml/rkw)

090 12/03/96	FIXED	Load session test/MM1System.tk, print to PostScript;
			'Pwi' text comes out at wrong place. (ml/rkw)

091 12/03/96	FIXED	Print all windows to PostScript with more than one
			window -> core dump. (ml/rkw)

092 12/04/96	CD	Load session test/MM1System.tk -> lowest label on
			Y axis is a very small number instead of zero.
			Problem does not seem to exist any longer. (ml/rkw)

093 12/04/96	FIXED	Opening a statistics view from any other view causes
                        a core dump.  (Load session demo/colors.tk, and then
                        open the histogram view).  The believed cause is the
                        TData detects a change in the data and then cancels
                        all queries on it, but the QP still has a pointer
                        to the current qdata (which was deleted by the cancel)
                        and tries to continue processing the query.

094 12/06/96	FIXED	Linux version won't run because of an error in the
			shared memory code. (rkw)

095 12/16/96	FIXED	'OK' button in mapping editor doesn't work. (rkw)

096 12/16/96	CD	Can't display histograms at all -- you get 'invalid
			command name "findNumericCaseValue"' from Tcl/Tk.
			(rkw)

097 12/16/96	FIXED	'Duplicate window' should make an entirely separate
			copy of the window -- changing mappings, etc., in
			one window should not affect the other one. (ml/rkw)

098 12/16/96	FIXED	Load session test/molbio_demo.tk -> clip mask doesn't
			work on two of three piled views. (rkw/jpm)
			(This is a specific instance of bug 071.)

099 12/16/96	NB	Load session test/molbio_demo.tk -> zooming doesn't
			work correctly (sometimes zooms in X and Y when it
			should zoom only in X). (rkw)
                        Session didn't mark time attr as sorted, so the
                        system thought the view must be a scatter plot,
                        regardless of the symbol type (a line).
                        Perhaps this behavior should be modified. (kb)

100 12/16/96	OPEN	If you import data into several windows and specify
			that there should be an X link, _all_ views are
			linked to a single link; it would probably be better
			to have each window have its own X link. (ml/rkw)
			Deferred

101 12/16/96	FIXED	'5' key sometimes doesn't work correctly (for example,
			load the session test/bad5key.tk). (ml/rkw)
                        Cause: recIds don't have hi/lo values.
                        Technical cause: recIds don't have AttrInfo in
                        the TData, (ie, map->MapGAttr2TAttr(MappingCmd_X)
                        returns NULL when X is mapped to recId).
			(Fixed by rkw, 10/20/98.)

102 12/17/96	OPEN	Control-c doesn't seem to be able to terminate
			Devise if you have an input-grabbing Tk dialog
			open. (rkw)
			Deferred

103 12/20/96	FIXED	Bold, italic, and New Century Schoolbook fonts
			don't work in PostScript. (rkw)

104 12/23/96	FIXED	AttrProj::LastRecId should report an error when
			called on TData that doesn't have an index.  (rkw)

105 12/26/96	FIXED	Print a view with a non-white background to
			PostScript -> there are "stripes" where white shows
			through because the various background areas don't
			quite touch each other. (rkw)

106 12/30/96	FIXED	Load the session test/a2.tk; you get the following
			error: DEVise error: RangeList::Insert() recId 4,4
			already processed at
			../../graphics.new/RangeList.c: 219. (It doesn't
        		matter whether or not you're using shared memory.)
                        (rkw/jpm)

107 01/06/97	OPEN	If you have more than 19 views, those views are
			named 'View 110', 'View 111', etc., instead of
			'View 20', etc. (rkw)
			Deferred

108 01/09/97	FIXED	Load the session /p/devise/session/test/jussitape.tk,
			print to PostScript -> some of the text comes out at
			the wrong place. (jpm/rkw)

109 01/09/97	CD  	Load the session /p/devise/test/baa1.tk, select the
			view in window DEViseWn1, bring up the Query Tool ->
			the axis limits are not filled in. (rkw/kb)

110 01/09/97	NB	Load the session /p/devise/test/baa1.tk, select the
			view in window DEViseWn1 -> you can't display
			axes in this view. Not a bug: foreground color
                        was the same as background color, so axes just
                        weren't visible. (rkw/jpm)

111 01/10/97	OPEN	Got the following bug when loading the session
			/p/devise/session/demo/COD1.tk, only with shared
			memory, and only (but consistently) on the HP
			architecture: An internal error has occurred. The
			reason is: Inconsistent state
			(../../graphics.new/TDataAscii.c:824). (rkw)
			Deferred

112 01/10/97	FIXED	If a fatal error occurs while running with shared
			memory, you need to manually kill off processes
			to clean up. (rkw/jpm)

113 01/10/97	OPEN	Devise does not clean up shared memory resources
			if it crashes. (rkw)
			Deferred

114 01/10/97	FIXED	Load session /p/devise/session/test/baa1.tk, select
			view 'Location 1 Visits', print -> the data in the
			'BAA.am' view doesn't get printed.

115 01/13/97	FIXED?	Load session test/molbio_demo.tk
                        XY zoom with mouse (button 3) produces what looks
                        like an X zoom and you must hit button '5' twice
                        to get the proper filter.
                        The cause is that the views are both X linked on
                        time and XY linked with the pile link.  To fix this
                        bug, the system needs to understand its links
                        better.  I think Shilpa's work should address this.
                        (kb)
			Deferred

116 01/13/97	FIXED	Load session /p/devise/session/test/birch.tk ->
			assertion fails indicating that points array
			in XWindowRep will overflow. (rkw)

117 01/14/97	OPEN	There are a number of places that variations on
			'records per batch' are independently defined to
			1024.  It looks like these must all be the same
			size and therefore should be defined in a single
			place. (rkw)
			Deferred

118 01/14/97	OPEN    Makefile couldn't find my.yacc.tab.h when making
			DEVise in dir like /p/devise/guangshu/test/solsparc
			(gc)
			Deferred

119 01/15/97	OPEN	If you have too many attributes, the 'Select X'
			menu in the 'Define Visualization' dialog goes
			off the bottom of the screen (ma/rkw)
			Deferred

120 01/15/97	OPEN	DTE/Makefile.base duplicates much of
			devread/Makefile.base. (rkw)
			Deferred

121 01/16/97	FIXED	Assertion 'color < Instance()->_numColors' in
			ColorMgr::GetColorRgb() failed when printing
			PostScript.  (Doesn't seem to be repeatable.) (rkw)

122 01/16/97	FIXED	Changing mapping (forcing data to be redrawn) goofs
			up the drawing of the view selection box. (rkw)
			(Setting FILL_WHOLE_BACKGROUND to 0 in View.c
			removed the fix for this bug.  rkw)

123 01/16/97	WORK	Load the sesson demo/COD1.tk; resize the 'Global
			View' window; then obscure any part of that window
			by raising another window -> the data area of the
			'Global View' window gets erased.  (Because the
			window is erroneously receiving an Expose event
			instead of the VisibilityNotify event it should
			be getting.) (rkw)
			Note: this bug shows up with fvwm but not with twm,
			tvtwm, or mwm.
			(Workaround in View::HandleExpose().)

124 01/17/97	FIXED	Drawing of the selection box gets goofed up if the
			actual data overdraws it. (rkw)

125 01/22/97	FIXED	When the help window is shown, the topics do not show
			up. (rkw)

126 01/22/97	FIXED	When views are unstacked, they're not always redrawn
			correctly. (rkw)

127 01/22/97	WORK	'Attributes' and 'Colors' buttons in Query Tool do
			nothing. (rkw)
			Workaround: removed the buttons.

128 01/22/97	FIXED	If you change both the X and Y values in the Query
			Tool on a view with X and Y links, only the X change
			takes effect. (rkw)

469 03/15/99	FIXED	'5' (home) key doesn't work right in views that are

490 05/18/99	FIXED	If a session contains piled views containing view
			symbols, closing the session or destroying a window
			may cause DEVise to crash (for example, in Tim
			Wilson's FullDaily3.ds session). (tw/rkw)
			(This is caused by a view symbol's X window being

491 05/18/99	FIXED	Duplicate elimination doesn't work properly for the

622 10/14/00	FIXED	Negative record links are not saved correctly in

624 11/13/00	OPEN	JavaScreen: do click-shift to drill down; if you

625 12/19/00	FIXED	JavaScreen: mouse location format doesn't work for

			(rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 8/1/02.)

626 12/21/00	FIXED	JavaScreen: JAVAC_ProtocolVersion command is initiated

627 12/21/00	OPEN	JavaScreen: applet in a browser doesn't go away
			when it sends the Exit command (you can see this

629 12/22/00	FIXED	JavaScreen: closing a session in CGI mode when

630 12/22/00	KLUDGED	JavaScreen: when running in CGI mode in Netscape,
			there's a communications error when you exit the
			client. (rkw)

631 12/22/00	OPEN	JavaScreen: command arguments in CGI mode have '_'
			appended to them on the way from the client to the
			CGI script, because having null-terminated strings
			somehow goofs up the CGI communication, and not having
			an extra character goofs things up, too. (rkw)

632 01/10/01	OPEN	The query dialog seems to get goofed up if it is

639 02/01/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: if you start the JSA twice in Netscape

			(Fixed by rkw, 2/5/01.)

640 02/02/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: clicking "Exit" in the JSA doesn't

			(Fixed by rkw, 2/5/01.)

641 02/13/01	OPEN	JavaScreen: run JSA in CGI mode, exit and start
			a new one without reloading the web page -- it
			starts out in CGI mode again, and runs into problems
			receiving from the jspop. (rkw)

642 02/19/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: if the JavaScreen connects to the jspop,
			but the command read times out, clicking Exit in the
			JS destroys the window, but doesn't actually end
			the process. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 2/19/01.)

643 02/23/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: jspop doesn't get JAVAC_Exit command

645 03/13/01	FIXED	Duplicating a window doesn't copy fonts. (rkw)

646 03/13/01	CD	JavaScreen: Lucida font family doesn't work for

647 03/13/01	NB	In JS demo session waveletidr/.Bugs/1d_example1a.ds,

648 03/15/01	OPEN	Duplicating a window doesn't work right if the

649 03/16/01	OPEN	If you change from a larger to a smaller color

			in the JavaScreen. (rkw)

650 03/19/01	OPEN	JavaScreen: "leader" JS on Win2k/IE,
			"collaborator" on Solaris/Netscape, "leader" has
			waveletidr/1d_example1b.ds open -- "follower" hangs
			on command 38 when it attempts to collaborate. (ml/rkw)

651 03/19/01	OPEN	JavaScreen: attempting to start collaboration with no
			session open in the "leader" causes problems. (rkw)

652 03/19/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: if collaborating JS exits while still
			in collaboration mode, the "leader" JS and the jspop

			(Fixed by xuk, 3/20/01.)

653 03/22/01	OPEN	If a 'control command' sent from the server to the

656 04/18/01	OPEN	JavaScreen: in the JSB, the title (including version

			display. (rkw)

657 04/20/01	OPEN	JavaScreen: if a collaboration leader goes into

			followers don't go out of collaboration mode; if
			they had a session opened before going into
			collaboration mode, they get goofed up. (rkw)

658 04/20/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: restoring pre-collaboration session

659 04/20/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: if no leaders are available for

			whether they've enabled collaboration if no follower
			is connected to them. (rkw)
			(Fixed by xuk, 4/21/01.)

661 04/20/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: if the user enables collaboration and
			then becomes a collaboration follower with that
			JS, the JS is still listed as a possible collaboration
			leader. (In other words, becoming a collaboration
			follower should disable being a collaboration
			leader.) (rkw)
			(Fixed by xuk, 4/25/01)

662 04/20/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: there is no GUI to *disable* collaboration.

			directory. (rkw)  (At least
			session.js/bmrb/dynamic_sessions.)
			(Fixed by rkw, 09/27/01.)

689 09/12/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: shouldn't draw zoom boxes in views in
			which zooming is disabled. (rkw)
			(Also shouldn't send command to devised.)
			(Fixed by rkw, 09/25/01.)

690 09/12/01	OPEN	JavaScreen: sometimes when you try to move a cursor,
			this gets interpreted as a zoom (it's like the JS
			doesn't realized that the mouse is on top of a
			cursor). (ml/rkw)

691 09/19/01	OPEN	Session files that are links don't show up in the
			Open File dialog unless you change the pattern. (rkw)

692 09/20/01	FIXED	If you open a session and save it without changing
			anything, the session file shouldn't be different
			(except for the date in the header). (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 8/22/02.)
			(See also bug 677.)

693 09/25/01	FIXED	If you are doing an X-only zoom, the rubberband
			line that is drawn should reflect this. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 09/26/01.)

694 09/25/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: if you are doing an X-only zoom, the
			rubberband line that is drawn should reflect this.
			(rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 09/26/01.)

695 09/25/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: if cursor movement is disallowed in
			a view, the user shouldn't be able to drag the
			drawn cursor, and no command should be sent to
			the devised. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 09/26/01.)

696 10/02/01	OPEN	JavaScreen: atom type shouldn't be required as
			ShapeAttr2 for 3D views. (rkw)

697 10/03/01	FIXED	Errors that occur when opening a session are not
			generally recorded well in the log files. (rkw)
			(The problem is that errors generated in
			DeviseCommand.C are not logged, and only the top-
			level error gets passed back up to the GUI (JS
			or Tcl/Tk.)
			(Fixed by rkw, 10/03/01.)

698 10/05/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: 3D manipulation doesn't work in
			command playback. (xuk/rkw)
			(Fixed by xuk, 10/05/01.)

699 10/05/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: if you specify a non-existant log file
			with the -clientlog argument, the JS totally locks
			up. (rkw)
			(Fixed by sjl, 6/19/02.)

700 10/05/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: if you specify -autoplayback or
			-playbackoriginal without specifying a log file,
			the JS should print an error message. (rkw)
			(Fixed by xuk, 10/05/01.)

701 10/05/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: simple file paths do not work for
			command log playback. (rkw)
			(Fixed by xuk, 10/05/01.)

702 10/05/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: bad command in log file being played
			back gets the JS permanently stuck in playback
			mode, seems to get jspop and/or devised into a
			non-responsive state. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 10/08/01.)

703 10/05/01	OPEN	JavaScreen: _pid files don't get deleted correctly
			if the machine goes down. (rkw)

704 10/05/01	FIXED?	JavaScreen: when restarting JSPoP, heartbeats sent
			from an existing client can (sometimes, at least)
			prevent the JSPoP from accepting other client
			connections. (rkw)

705 10/05/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: the JSPoP should not create client log
			files for clients that only send a JAVAC_CheckPop
			command. (rkw)
			(Fixed by xuk, 10/05/01.)

706 10/05/01	FIXED?	JavaScreen: if you quit while the JS is talking to
			the server, the JS process doesn't seem to actually
			exit. (rkw)
			(This seems to be fixed now.  rkw 6/27/02.)

707 10/08/01	OPEN	Collaboration (non-JavaScreen-based) no longer works.
			(rkw)

708 10/16/01	OPEN	JavaScreen: the client shouldn't allow the user to
			perform any actions while it's sleeping during timed
			command log playback. (rkw)

709 10/16/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: there should be some visual indication
			of being in command playback mode. (rkw)
                        (Fixed by xuk, 10/19/01.)

710 10/16/01	OPEN	JavaScreen: sleep time in timed command playback
			should be adjusted to account for the time taken
			by the execution of the previous command. (rkw)

711 10/16/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: command playback cannot be done in
			timed mode if not displaying. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 10/16/01.)

712 10/16/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: collaboration no longer works. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 10/16/01.)

713 10/16/01	FIXED?	JavaScreen: collaboration doesn't work right when
			collaborating clients have different screen sizes.
			(rkw)

714 10/16/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: collaboration follower cannot switch
			out of collaboration mode (in Netscape, but not
			as an application). (rkw)
                        (Fixed by xuk, 10/18/01.)

715 10/16/01	OPEN	JavaScreen: in command playback mode, 3D configuration
			commands are not always properly syncronized with
			other commands, since they don't go through the
			dispatcher (especially if not playing back in timed
			mode). (rkw)

716 10/18/01	OPEN	JavaScreen: the JSPoP main thread is not registered
			with the thread checker. (rkw)

717 10/19/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: needs better GUI for switching into and
			out of collaboration mode (separate this from socket
			vs. CGI). (elu/rkw)
			(Fixed by xuk, 11/??/01.)

718 10/22/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: client sockets seem to never get removed
			from active sockets list in JSPoP. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 10/22/01.)

719 10/22/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: the JSPoP doesn't clean up properly after
			receiving a connection request from a client with an
			invalid ID. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 10/24/01.)

720 10/22/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: all clients are blocked if the JSPoP
			blocks while reading a client command. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 10/24/01.)

721 10/23/01	NB	JavaScreen: when a collaboration client exits or
			goes out of collaboration mode, the corresponding
			socket is not closed in the JSPoP. (rkw)
			(I was mistaken about this, I think.)

722 10/24/01	WORK?	JavaScreen: collaborator client can goof up leader
			by sending erroneous commands. (rkw)  (Note: GUI
			doesn't normally let the user do anything, but if
			the collaborator sends a command, the JSPoP doesn't
			necessarily distinguish it from the leader.)

723 10/24/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: CGI mode doesn't work anymore. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 11/07/01.)

724 10/28/01	FIXED?	JavaScreen: command/socket code parses commands
			unnecessarily and doesn't unabiguously preserve
			argument divisions (e.g., spaces within arguments
			can cause problems). (rkw)

725 10/29/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: -cgiurl command-line argument doesn't work
			in client. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 11/07/01.)

v726 11/01/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: if the jspop is running, but there is
			no devised, and a client connects, the JSPoP should
			return an error message to the client, rather than
			just leaving it hanging. (rkw)
			(Fixed by xuk, 01/24/02.)

727 11/20/01	FIXED	Line graphs don't work in DEVise if the records are
			not in order of the X axis attribute. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 12/28/01.)

728 11/21/01	OPEN	Automatic filter updates (if enabled) should probably
			be retriggered for a child view every time the parent
			view changes anything about the child. (rkw)  (Or
			at least when the Child Value changes.)

729 11/21/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: mouse X location is not displayed correctly
			for views with date on the X axis. (ml/rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 11/21/01.)

730 11/26/01	FIXED	Line graphs don't work in DEVise if the view is a
			record link follower. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 12/28/01.)

731 11/27/01	OPEN	Automatic filter updates don't seem to work right in
			piled child views -- the whole thing seems to do a
			home as each child is added to the pile, as opposed
			to doing a home on the whole pile once all views are
			in place. (rkw)

732 11/27/01	DUP	Home on child views doesn't work right in JS demo
			session PaulB/sample3.ds.  It seems like it's partly
			the record links, and partly the piling of views; and
			maybe the fact that the views are child views also
			comes into it. (When you first do home, the X and Y
			values are usually wrong, then a second home fixes
			things.) (rkw)

733 11/27/01	OPEN	JavaScreen: in the JS demo session PaulB/sample3.ds,
			the "100k Files" and "5k Files" views show only one
			view in the child view piles. (rkw)  (Seems to be
			fixed by putting each parent view in its own window.
			See PaulB/sample3_bug733.ds for version that fails.)

734 11/27/01	FIXED	Creation of debug log file fails if the
			/tmp/<usr>-devise-tmp directory doesn't already
			exist. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 3/14/02.)

735 11/28/01	FIXED	'Home' (5) doesn't work right in the JS demo session
			PaulB/sample3.ds (in the child views).  If you do
			home twice in a row, you get a different filter value.
			(rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 1/11/02.)

736 11/28/01	OPEN	JavaScreen: dragging one side of a cursor past the
			other ("flipping" the cursor) doesn't work right.
			(rkw)

737 11/28/01	FIXED	Creating a view with a visual filter in which the low
			and high values are the same crashes DEVise (only
			relevant for non-DEVise-generated session files).
			(rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 11/30/01.)

738 11/30/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: attempting to start collaboration when
			the leader does not have a session open causes
			problems. (rkw)
			(Fixed by xuk, 01/24/02.)

739 11/30/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: pre-collaboration state is not restored
			if you cancel before completely going into
			collaboration mode or enter the wrong collaboration
			password. (rkw)
			(Fixed by xuk, 01/24/02.)

740 12/10/01	FIXED	When saving a session file with per-session data
			source definitions, environment variable names should
			be substituted in as they are when writing to the
			main data source catalog. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 12/12/01.)

741 12/13/01	FIXED	Displaying a TData from the Edit dialog does not
			work. (gk/rkw)
			(See 578.)
			(Fixed by wenger, 8/24/04.)

742 12/18/01	FIXED	JavaScreen: change of mouse location causes
			irritating flickering of the mouse location display
			area even if display is disabled. (rkw)
			(Fixed by sjl, 6/19/02.)

743 12/28/01	OPEN	Visual filter does not select records for line and
			line shade (all records are passed to drawing
			methods). (rkw)  (Note: this is done so that lines
			that cross the filter but have a point outside the
			filter are drawn.)

744 12/28/01	FIXED	Dragging with mouse sometimes doesn't zoom when
			it should. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 12/28/01.)

745 1/7/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: display of mouse X location doesn't
			work right in Asos.ds. (rkw)
			(Shows up only in older JS version.)

746 1/7/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: mouse location display shows 0.0 even
			when the format is - (blank). (rkw)

747 1/10/02	OPEN	Axis multiplication factor doesn't get copied when
			a view is copied. (rkw)

748 1/11/02	OPEN	Y-only home sets Y axis based on all data, not just
			the data within the current X range. (rkw)
			(See Bug 748.ds, Bug748b.ds.)

749 1/17/02	FIXED	Y-only link on a view prevents home from happening
			in the X direction, even if home configuration
			says it should (see Test/Bug749.ds). (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 4/25/02.)

750 2/5/02	FIXED	Sessions with more than one child view pile in a single
			parent view cause infinite looping with XFree86 4.1.0
			(part of the RedHat 7.2 setup) (see
			Test/view_sym_pile2.ds). (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 2/5/02.)

751 2/5/02	FIXED	The JavaScreen runs incredibly slowly on RedHat 7.2.
			(rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 2/6/02.)

752 2/5/02	OPEN	JavaScreen: dialogs don't show up right when the
			JavaScreen is compiled with Java 1.2 (as opposed to
			1.1). (rkw)

753 2/5/02	FIXED	In NRG demo sessions, the selected views no longer
			fill the main window when you select only a subset
			of the available views. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 6/11/02.)

754 2/8/02	FIXED	Create a session by displaying a data source
			and try to save it -> DEVise crashes. Opening an
			existing session and re-saving it works okay. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 2/9/02.)

755 2/11/02	FIXED	Data source creation GUI should default to having
			the schema selection dialog come up in the physical
			schema directory. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 8/15/02.)

756 1/31/02	OPEN	Schema attribute names with '(' in them don't work
			right in the GUI -- the schema parser should complain
			about them. (rkw)

757 3/11/02	FIXED	'Home' (5 key) doesn't seem to be working very well in
			the Y direction on the antares session. (See
			session.js/test/antares_bad_y_home.ds.) (rkw)
			(Re-tested by rkw, 6/11/02.)

758 3/11/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: moving a 3D object produces the error
			message "Cannot find view". (rkw)  (I thought I
			had fixed this before, but the problem is still
			showing up.  This is turning out to be very hard
			to duplicate -- it shows up on the "regular" JS on
			pumori but nowhere else.)
			(Fixed by rkw, 3/12/02.)

759 3/26/02	OPEN	JavaScreen: if a view containing a cursor has 'exclude'
			set in the print configuration, the JavaScreen can't
			open the session at all. (rkw)

760 3/26/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: client has index out of range errors
			when trying to draw axis labels for the session
			test/axis_label_error.ds. (rkw)
			(Fixed by xuk, 4/4/02.)

761 3/26/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: X axis labels are not "clean" values
			for the session test/axis_label_error.ds. (rkw)
			(Fixed by xuk, 4/10/02.)

762 4/2/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: axis labeling code does not handle
			axis multiplication factors. (rkw)
			(Fixed by xuk, 4/4/02.)

763 4/2/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: mouse location display code does not
			handle axis multiplication factors. (rkw)
			(Fixed by xuk, 4/4/02.)
	
764 3/28/02	WORK	JavaScreen: default password doesn't show up in
			collaboration enabling GUI on Miron's laptop (WinXP);
			getting into collab mode locked up both the leader
			and follower. (rkw/ml)

765 4/2/02	FIXED?	JavaScreen: backspace key (to toggle between the last
			two visual filters) doesn't work. (rkw)
			(Saw this at BMRB, on Steve Mading's machine
			(lobster).) (Two problems here -- backspace in opera
			sends 0xff08 instead of 0x0008; in both opera and
			netscape, if backspace is recognized commands are
			sent but the view image is not updated properly.)
			(Put in fix for part 1 of this -- rkw 4/9/02.)
			(Part 2 may be fixed -- see bug 775 -- rkw 4/19/02.)

766 4/2/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: view help seems to cause problems in
			collaboration mode. (rkw)
			(Fixed by xuk, 4/4/02.)

767 4/2/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: collaboration GUI should be more
			clear.(rkw)
			(Fixed by xuk, 4/4/02.)

768 4/2/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: in collaboration mode, when the leader
			shows the record value dialog (and therefore the
			follower also shows it), the follower's doesn't
			go away when the leader's does (the follower's user
			has to click the OK button). (rkw)
			(Fixed by xuk, 4/4/02.)

769 4/2/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: we should have an alternative to
			alt-drag for zooming out, because on many systems
			alt-drag is intercepted by the window manager (to
			move the window). (rkw)
			(Fixed by xuk, 4/4/02.)

770 4/4/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: when the user does a key action in a
			view with key actions disabled, they should get
			a dialog telling them that their action is not
			allowed in that view (see also bug 765). (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 4/9/02.)

771 4/5/02	OPEN	JavaScreen: in collaboration mode, when the leader
			clicks and shows the record value dialog, the follower
			has no way to tell where the leader clicked, so there
			should be some kind of a mark on the screen of both
			the leader and the follower. (rkw/ml)

772 4/5/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: arrow keys no longer work in stand-alone
			JS (they still work within netscape). (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 4/9/02.)

773 4/9/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: in the session bmrb/4096_side3h.ds,
			enlarge residue selection cursor to full view, rotate
			3D object, do 'r' in 3D view -> always seems to
			generate warning about JS still talking to the
			server. (rkw)
			(This seems to show up in the stand-alone JS, but
			not when running within Netscape(!).)
			(Fixed by xuk, 4/10/02.)

774 4/17/02	FIXED	JavaScreen has hard-coded '/p/devise' strings.
			(rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 4/18/02.)

775 4/17/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: backspace key (to go to a view's previous
			visual filter) doesn't work if there has been a
			client switch since the view's filter was changed.
			(rkw)
			(Maybe related to bug 765?)
			(Fixed by rkw, 4/19/02.)

776 4/19/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: collaboration-related commands were not 
			recorded in client command log file. (xuk)
			(Fixed by xuk, 4/19/02.)

777 4/23/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: when the JS has to repaint because of
			an expose even on an X server with no backing store,
			the repaint takes much longer than the initial
			painting of the window (especially redrawing the
			axes and the titles). (rkw)
			(Fixed by xuk, 4/24/02.)

778 4/26/02	FIXED?	JavaScreen: collab password for leader is never set
			to the default value in the applet (it is in the
			stand-alone version). (rkw)

779 5/20/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: client switching sometimes fails when
			more than one DEVised is running (because the
			temporary session directory only gets set in the
			first DEVised). (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 5/20/02.)

780 5/21/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: if a client switch happens on a client
			that doesn't have a session open, an error occurs
			because the DEVised is told to open a non-existant
			temporary session file. (rkw)
			(Fixed by xuk, 5/23/02.)

781 5/21/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: 'autotest all' does not clearly report
			failure if test1 fails. (rkw)
			(Fixed by xuk, 5/23/02.)

782 5/22/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: JS hangs when requesting JSPoP status
			if there is more than one DEVised. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 5/24/02.)

783 5/28/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: in the session aart1_EmEn.ds display of
			mouse location does not work in the main view. (rkw)
                        (Fixed by sjl, 6/4/2002)

784 5/28/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: in the session aart1_EmEn.ds axis labels
			on the X axis of the main view were sometimes not
			correct. (rkw)
                        (Fixed by sjl, 6/4/2002)

785 5/29/02     FIXED   JavaScreen: in the session aart1_EmEn.ds, the X value
                        of the mouse location displayed is sometimes missing 0s.
                        Example: value '9.0768E7' appears as '9.768E7'. <sjl>
                        (Fixed by sjl, 6/4/2002)

786 6/5/02      FIXED 	JavaScreen: From the 'Collaborate' menu choosing 
                        'Become a Leader' and then hitting 'Cancel' will make 
                        the JavaScreen believe that it is a leader. <sjl>
                        (Fixed by sjl, 6/5/2002)

787 6/11/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: In collaboration, when you become the leader
			of a group, the option to 'Become Follower' is still
                        available. <sjl>
			(Fixed by sjl, 6/11/2002)

788 6/11/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: The message to the right of the buttons
			on the top of the JavaScreen says 'Collaboration' only
			when that JavaScreen is a follower, but not when it is
			a leader. <sjl>
			(Fixed by sjl, 6/11/2002)

789 6/11/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: If two JavaScreens are collaborating with one
                        being the leader and the other following, if the follower
			hits the 'Open' button, it will lock up until the
			leader stops leading or exits. <sjl>
			(Fixed by sjl, 6/12/2002)

790 6/11/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: If two JavaScreens are collaborating with one
                        being the leader and the other following, if the follower
			hits the 'Stop' button, it will lock up until the
			leader stops leading or exits.  This differs from 789 by
  			the button that causes the lock-up.  <sjl>
			(Fixed by sjl, 6/12/2002)

791 6/11/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: If two JavaScreens are collaborating with one
                        being the leader and the other following, if the follower
			requests the 'Jspop Status' from the 'Options' dialogue box, 
                        it will lock up until the leader stops leading or exits. <sjl>
			(Fixed by sjl, 6/12/2002)

792 6/11/02	OPEN	JavaScreen: Two JavaScreens are collaborating with one being
			the leader and the other following.  The leader will open a
			session, the follower will then quit following, the leader then
 			closes the session and then quits leading.  If the leader then
			starts a new group of which it is the leader, but does not open
			any session, then the follower joins the leader's new group, the 
			last screen from the session that the follower saw from the original
			group will now appear on the follower JavaScreen even though the
			leader does not have any sessions currently open. <sjl>

793 6/11/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: Two JavaScreens are collaborating with one being the
			leader and the other following.  The follower hits the 'Collaborate'
			button and then 'Become Follower' then 'Collaborate' again and then 
			'Become Follower' again.  The follower now has two windows called 
			'Current Active Clients' open to choose the group that it would like
			to join.  Use one window to join a group, then do anything with the
			second window, including 'Cancel', and the follower will lock up. <sjl>
			(Fixed by sjl, 6/14/2002)

794 6/13/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: The JavaScreen will lock up if the 'Help' button is quickly
			pushed twice so that the second push is while the 'Stop' button is
			red from the first push. <sjl>
			(Fixed by sjl, 6/14/2002)

795 6/17/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: A group is formed by a leader.  Another JS tries to also start
			a group with the same name as the existing group.  It will get a message
			saying the name is already used.  If it then hits "OK" then "Cancel" on the
			"Setting Collaboration Name & Password" box, the JS will believe that
			it is a leader, even though it isn't. <sjl>
			(Fixed by sjl, 6/17/2002)

796 6/17/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: when becoming a collaboration leader,
			I got the "JavaScreen is busy working Please try again
			later" message (I think maybe the collaboration command
			overlapped with a heartbeat).  Anyhow, the JS GUI
			showed that it was a collaboration leader, but it
			did not show up as a leader when I tried to become a
			follower with a different JS. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 9/27/02.)

797 6/17/02	OPEN	JavaScreen: figure out how to make things work if
			the JS window is too narrow to show all of the GUI
			elements as they are currently laid out. (rkw)

798 6/26/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: JS reports mouse location even when mouse
			is outside the data area of a view. (rkw)
			(Fixed by sjl, 8/29/2002)

799 6/28/02	OPEN	JavaScreen: zoom in too much and axis labels get
			goofed up (load test/bad_js_axes.ds, zoom in 2-3
			times). (rkw)  (Note: this bug seems to show up
			differently in Netscape than when you just run the
			JS as a stand-alone program.)

800 6/28/02	FIXED	Zoom in too far and symbol disappears!!  (See
			test/symbol_disappears.ds, test/symbol_disappears2.ds.)
			(rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 7/25/02.)

801 7/3/02	OPEN	JavaScreen: if you try to view a directory that has
			too many session files (e.g., the BMRB dynamic
			sessions directory), you run into problems: it takes
			a really long time to get the session file list, and
			if you click Cancel on the dialog while getting the
			list, you get hung. (rkw)

802 7/3/02	OPEN	JavaScreen: do a collaboration on the 4096 3D session,
			show all residues in the 3D view, do various
			manipulations -> things eventually lock up (at least
			on yola). (rkw)

803 7/3/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: in log playback GUI, "Set" should be
			"Play" or something like that. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 8/16/02.)

804 7/3/02	OPEN	JavaScreen: error message for bad log file doesn't
			work on yola. (rkw)

805 7/3/02	OPEN	JavaScreen: 4096_full.ds (with balls) caused lockup
			on yola. (rkw)

806 8/5/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: axes should have at least two ticks if
			at all possible (space ticks closer together if the
			view is very small). (sp/rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 8/16/02.)

807 8/5/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: doing reload twice in Netscape goofs
			up the applet. (sp/rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 8/16/02.)

808 8/14/02	FIXED	Binary data works only if values are "naturally"
			aligned as they are defined by the schema. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 8/15/02.)

809 8/14/02	OPEN	Values from some attributes of non-matching records
			can still contribute to attribute high/low values
			(see TDataAsciiInterp/TDataBinaryInterp::Decode).
			(rkw)

810 8/15/02	FIXED	Child view titles can go outside of the child view
			(see session test/child_view_title.ds). (sp/rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 9/27/02.)

811 8/19/02	OPEN	JavaScreen: timer to destroy a non-visible applet
			instance doesn't work if another applet instance
			is running. (rkw)

812 8/22/02	FIXED	Problem with queries in piled child views in
			certain circumstances (see test/bad_pile_query.ds).
			Note that if you swap View 16 and View 11 the
			problem goes away.) (rkw)
			(Problem seems to be with the combination of swapping
			and piling the views.  If you swap the views and then
			pile them, you get problems.  If you swap the views
			(unpiled), save and restore the session, and then
			pile them, you seem to be okay.)
			(Fixed by rkw, 8/23/02.)

813 8/22/02	FIXED	Bars are drawn wrong for negative Y values!!  (See
			test/bad_bars.ds). (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 8/22/02.)

814 8/22/02	NB	Error indicators seem to be drawn wrong for bars.
			(rkw)
			(Seems like the error values are absolute, not
			relative to the bar Y values -- rkw, 8/22/02.)

815 8/22/02	NB	JavaScreen: the session test/3d_goofs_up_js.ds
			doesn't work right in the JavaScreen (the view
			with the selected data values stays blank). (rkw)
			(View was somehow set to 3D, and GData was not
			sent to the JS.  rkw, 8/27/02.)

816 8/23/02	OPEN	Piles, at least sometimes, generate an awful lot
			of view refreshes (for example, View 14 in test/
			bad_pile_query.ds). (Turn on query count in
			View::ReportQueryDone().) (rkw)

817 8/23/02	FIXED	In test/date_format_problem.ds, View 2 is not
			drawn when the session is opened; if that view is
			hidden and then exposed, it's drawn correctly.
			(rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 8/27/02.)

818 8/23/02	FIXED	viewGoHome {View 10} in session postscript of
			test/bad_pile_query.ds doesn't correctly update
			the visual filters of the whole pile. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 8/23/02.)

819 8/26/02	WORK	Attempting to display a data source with recId
			on the Y axis results in the relevant view not
			even being created. (rkw)
			(Workaround by rkw, 8/27/02.)

820 8/30/02	FIXED	Shift-click (drill-down) on lines is awfully
			picky about the location of the click to actually
			find a record. (rkw)
			(Fixed by wenger, 11/21/03.)

821 9/9/02	FIXED	GAttr links don't work right when the follower view
			has "complex" symbols (including 3D). (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 9/10/02.)

822 9/9/02	OPEN	Statistics values in Query dialog should not be
			editable. (rkw)

823 9/10/02	OPEN	Orientation of 360 deg. sometimes introduces
			distortion into Rects (this is why the highlights
			in 4096_side3h.ds are sometimes distorted). (rkw)

824 9/16/02	FIXED	GAttr links show up as record links in the "Set
			Record Link Type" dialog. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 9/16/02.)

825 9/16/02	OPEN	"Set Record Link Type" dialog doesn't automatically
			select the current type. (rkw)

826 10/1/02	OPEN	If DEVise has already parsed a schema with a given
			"type", it ignores any new schemas with the same
			"type", and re-uses the old one (even if the new
			schema is in a different file and is truly different
			from the old one). (gk/rkw)

827 10/28/02	OPEN	JavaScreen: no-reload feature doesn't seem to work
			in Mozilla. (sp/rkw)

828 10/28/02	OPEN	JavaScreen: dialogs show up tiny in Mozilla. (sp/rkw)

829 10/28/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: if two restart_jspops overlap, the jspop
			log file can get goofed up. (rkw)
			(Fixed by wenger, 1/27/03.)

830 11/1/02	OPEN	When switching data types in the BMRB 3D visualizations,
			the mapping reports errors because of mismatching
			attributes.  (This doesn't result in an actual error,
			because things get matched up eventually; but there's
			a temporary mismatch between the data source and
			the attribute controlled by the parent view during
			the course of the switch.) (rkw)

831 11/5/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: if the JSPoP gets stuck in
			DEViseCommSocket.doSendData(), it cannot respond to
			any other commands, including JAVAC_CheckPops.  (This
			problem is showing up on tuna at BMRB.  It seems like
			the socket buffers are set up in such a way that if
			the client gets goofed up, the JSPoP gets stuck trying
			to write data to it.)  This can cause an erroneous
			JSPoP restart, because the JSPoP fails to respond to
			the check_connect within the timeout. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 11/5/02.)

832 11/6/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: the "The specified scrollbar value is
			greater than the maximum scrollbar value minus the
			scrollbar slider size." warning is showing up again
			(this time in Mozilla). (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 11/22/02.)

833 11/11/02	OPEN	JavaScreen: various combinations of forward/back/
			reload fail in Mozilla. (rkw)

834 11/15/02	OPEN	If a view tries to update a VisualLink's filter, but
			the filter is locked, this can produce an inconsistent
			state (linked views have different visual filters).
			(This may be a problem mostly with automatic updates
			in session files -- when the user does things manually,
			the VisualLink may get run before it really becomes
			a problem.) (rkw)

835 11/15/02	OPEN	DevAxis::OptimizeTickMarks() can get into an
			infinite recursion. (rkw)

836 11/18/02	OPEN	If two cursors in the same view have the same color
			and end up on top of each other, they become invisible.
			(rkw)

837 11/19/02	OPEN	Sessions with child views can get into infinite loops
			(see CondorTest/UserWeekInfiniteLoop.ds). (rkw)
			(Seems to have something to do with trying to draw
			the same child view more than once in a parent view.)

838 11/20/02	OPEN	Closing a session during a redraw can cause an
			assertion (try CondorTest/UserThumb.ds). (rkw)

839 12/03/02	NB	JavaScreen: when opening a session (e.g., opening
			a temporary session when adding a collaboration
			follower) warnings are not distinguished from errors.
			(rkw)
			(See bug 841.)

840 12/03/02	NB	JavaScreen: when a collaboration follower connects,
			if there is a problem with the temporary session file
			created to get the follower in the right state, the
			leader and the follower both get in the wrong state.
			(rkw)
			(See bug 841.)

841 12/03/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: collaboration doesn't work right on
			sessions with postscripts. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 12/3/02.)

842 12/05/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: after more than one client gets a
			"connection reset by peer" error the JSPoP can get
			into a state where it's continually doing client
			switches without actually running any commands.
			(Seen at BMRB on albacore.)
			(Fixed by rkw, 12/5/02.)

843 12/13/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: the Wavelet-IDR html code still creates
			too many applet instances (seems to be related to
			doing form submit rather than reload). (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 12/17/02.)

844 12/13/02	FIXED	JavaScreen: drawing rubberband lines in a child view
			whose parent has many other children is slow.  (This
			is at least partly because the axes of all child views
			are being redraw on every rubberband drag.) (sp/rkw)
			(See also bug 845.)  (Note: we're redrawing the
			*entire* canvas every time the rubberband line
			changes.)
			(Fixed by rkw, 12/17/02.)
			
845 12/13/02	OPEN	JavaScreen: repaints do too much work -- axes and
			GData are redrawn from scratch, for example.  Can
			we buffer an image that already has that stuff drawn,
			and just redraw cursors and rubberband lines?
			(sp/rkw)
			(See also bugs 591, 628, 777.)

846 12/13/02	OPEN	JavaScreen: redrawing a view with a large number of
			child views is too slow (perhaps because of destroying
			and re-creating the child views). (sp/rkw)

847 11/15/02	OPEN	Home on multiple visual links is not transitive
			(see Test/transitive_link_failure.ds). (rkw)

848 12/16/02	OPEN	JavaScreen: in collaboration mode, when the leader
			zooms, follower(s) should get some visual indication
			of which region is being zoomed on. (ks/rkw)

849 12/17/02	OPEN	JavaScreen: dragging cursors should also not repaint
			the whole canvas. (rkw)  (See also bug 844.)

850 12/18/02	NLR	JavaScreen (in Mozilla, at least): load jsa.html,
			exit, do a reload in the browser:
			you get the error message "You do not have any opened
			session!" and can't restart the JavaScreen. If you
			don't click "Exit" in the JSA before doing the reload,
			the JSA starts, but then locks up after showing the
			session. (rkw)
			(Okay, this only happens when the reloadapplet
			parameter is false.  rkw, 12/18/02.) 

851 01/02/03	FIXED	Bars (and maybe also Rects) seem to be about one pixel
			too big in both the X and Y directions (see
			Test/Bug851.ds) (wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 1/7/03.)

852 01/02/03	FIXED	X- and Y-axis ticks may be off by one pixel from data
			values. (wenger)

853 01/02/03	FIXED	Minimum-size Rects seem to be larger than one pixel.
			(wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 1/7/03.)

854 01/03/03	FIXED	JavaScreen: X- and Y-axis ticks may be off by one pixel
			from data values. (wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 1/7/03.)

855 01/03/03	FIXED	Vertical lines at filter.xhi and horizontal lines at
			filter.yhi do not show up (it looks like WindowRep
			transforms are not set up correctly). (wenger)

856 01/04/03	FIXED	Axis tick marks at filter.xhi and filter.yhi are not
			drawn (for example, if the axes go from 0.0 to 1.0
			the 1.0 ticks are not drawn). (wenger)

857 01/07/03	OPEN	The bottommost pixel of the Y axis line is sometimes
			not drawn. (wenger)

858 01/07/03	FIXED	Bars in the CondorTest/UserWeek.ds session miss the
			X axis by one pixel. (wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 2/7/03.)

859 01/14/03	FIXED	Equal-width (in data units) bars and rects sometimes
			end up unequal width in pixels.  (Whether this is a
			bug or not really is kind of an aesthetic judgement,
			since there are unavoidable rounding problems.)
			(wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 2/6/03.)

860 01/15/03	FIXED	Axis labeling may not be the same in views with
			different axis multiplication factors but the same
			"apparent" filter range. (parker/wenger)

861 01/15/03	FIXED	JavaScreen: axis labeling may not be the same in
			views with different axis multiplication factors but
			the same "apparent" filter range. (parker/wenger)

862 01/28/03	FIXED	JavaScreen: main view in antares/aart1_EmEn.ds shows
			no data (see also test/antares_data_missing4.ds).

			(Fixed by wenger, 1/28/03.)

863 02/05/03	OPEN	Home does not work right on views with Vector symbols.

864 02/07/03	FIXED	Single-pixel wide bar isn't correctly lined up with
			axis ticks (at least sometimes). (See Test/Bug864.ds.)
			(wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 2/7/03.)

865 02/25/03	FIXED	Latest axis labeling code doesn't work for negative
			axis multiplication factors. (wenger)

866 03/13/03	FIXED	JSPoP gets null pointer if a client requests
			collaboration with a bad collaboration name.
			(parker/wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 3/13/03.)

867 03/28/03	OPEN	JavaScreen: if you run the embedded JS in Netscape,
			do back and then forward, the JS shows up at the
			wrong position in the Netscape, and not all of it
			is shown. (Seems to work okay in Mozilla.) (wenger)

868 04/18/03	OPEN	Physical schema GUI allows duplicate attribute names.
			(wenger)

869 04/24/03	OPEN	Home doesn't work right on single-record views with
			zero-size symbols (just keeps current visual filter,
			even if the symbol is outside it). (wenger)

870 04/25/03	FIXED	JavaScreen: if a follower crashes or loses its
			network connection, the leader gets an "Abrupt end
			of input stream" error the next time it tries to
			do something. (parker/wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 4/29/03.)

871 05/08/03	FIXED	Home (5 key) doesn't work right in views that are
			GAttr link followers (symbols excluded by the link
			are still used in determining home). (wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 8/1/03.)

872 05/21/03	FIXED	JavaScreen: if you double-click *twice* quickly
			enough in the session opening dialog, the item
			you click on gets appended to the path twice.
			(dmaziuk/wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 5/21/03.)

873 05/21/03	FIXED	Error bars on bar shapes are not properly aligned
			horizontally (see Bug873.ds). (wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 5/21/03.)

874 05/21/03	FIXED	Home on view with bars sometimes takes two tries
			to set Y Min to 0.0 (see Bug874.ds). (wenger)
			(Note: part of the problem is that X is recId --
			that causes ViewData to not process all records;
			therefore the data limits are invalid.)
			(Fixed by wenger, 5/22/03.)

875 05/29/03	WORK?	Wavelet-IDR is getting quite a few "Inconsistent
			validity flag" errors in TDataAscii. (parker/wenger)
			(Fixes failed; hopefully have a workaround figured
			out. wenger 7/1/03.)

876 05/30/03	FIXED	We sometimes get "pixel value overflow" errors in
			the duplicate elimination code with the
			restraint_proto4.ds session. (wenger)
			(Open session, change main views to 2D, maximize
			residues cursor, maximize bottom cursor, maximize
			constraints cursor.)  (See also Test/Bug876.ds.)
			(Fixed by wenger, 6/20/03.)

877 06/06/03	FIXED	Error indicators on bars (or is it home margins??)
			seem to really goof up home -- takes two tries to
			set Y to anything reasonable (see Bug877.ds). (wenger)
			(Seems to have gotten fixed somewhere along the
			line -- wenger 6/16/03.)

878 06/06/03	OPEN	Y-only home fails on view with recId for X (see
			Bug878.ds). (wenger)

879 06/13/03	FIXED	Initial visual filters are wrong (and home doesn't
			work right) in JS session Condor/UserThumb.ds. (wenger)
			(See also Test/Bug879.ds.)
			(Fixed by wenger, 6/15/03.)

880 06/25/03	FIXED	A view with RectX symbols *always* tries to call the
			external process code. (wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 6/25/03.)

881 06/26/03	OPEN	Invalidating TData on bad record doesn't work exactly
			right (open Test/index_test_big.ds, append spaces
			to line 50000 of dat/index_test, zoom -> you get
			duplicates of the last few records).  (If you re-
			open the session from scratch, things are okay.)

882 05/16/03	OPEN	JavaScreen crash on Mac (see ~/Mail/wavelet/js_errors).
			(kline/wenger)

883 07/29/03	OPEN	Small views sometimes have awfully few axis ticks.
			(wenger)

884 07/30/03	OPEN	Home doesn't work right on views with bar symbols and
			count mappings (the bounding boxes are not calculated
			correctly).  (Note that the bounding boxes depend on
			the value given for the put attribute in the mapping,
			which is actually ignored otherwise.) (wenger)

885 07/31/03	FIXED	"Y Min Zero" on home doesn't work at all! (wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 8/1/03.)

886 08/01/03	FIXED	Home (5 key) does nothing at all in the main view
			of JS demo session bmrb/chem_shift_ref/home_bug.ds
			if no symbols are currently shown! (wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 8/1/03.)

887 08/01/03	OPEN	Home on a view with count mapping takes two tries
			to get it right (one for X, one for Y). (wenger)

888 08/01/03	NB	A piled view set to X-only home still contributes to
			Y home on its pile (X-only home seems to work
			correctly if the view is not piled). (wenger)
			(Oops -- I had another view in the pile that was
			giving the Y home value. wenger)

889 10/28/03	FIXED	If hostname lookup in the JSPoP in
			socket1.getInetAddress().getHostName() takes a long
			time, the JSPoP gets goofed up because it cannot
			accept any more connections until the call returns.
			(One host took four minutes at BMRB). (wenger)

890 11/19/03	FIXED	Drill-down dialog on demo session antares/aart1_2d.ds
			shows up totally black. (wenger)
			(Fixed by rkw, 8/23/04.)

891 11/19/03	FIXED	Drill-down dialog doesn't seem to properly limit
			how much it displays (see Test/Bug890.ds). (wenger)

892 11/19/03	FIXED	Drill-down is often way too fussy about *exactly*
			hitting a symbol. (wenger/et al)
			(Fixed by wenger, 11/21/03.)

893 11/20/03	FIXED	Drill-down doesn't work right on views that are
			GAttr link followers (filtered records still show
			up). (wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 11/21/03.)

894 11/21/03	FIXED	Drill-down doesn't work right on *orange* bars in
			the top view of the JS demo session Condor/UserWeek.ds
			(it reports the child view name instead of the actual
			data).  It works okay on the yellow bars, in all
			of the other views(!). (wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 11/24/03.)

895 11/21/03	OPEN	Drill-down still doesn't work real well on lines --

896 11/24/03	FIXED	Drill-down doesn't work right on views with count

897 1/5/04	OPEN	JavaScreen: the embedded applet sometimes comes up
			half-size in Netscape on Windows; the "Please wait --
			Loading Applet for DEVise JavaScreen" message doesn't
			get totally covered up. (elu/wenger)

898 1/5/04	OPEN	At least some keypad commands (e.g., 'c') don't work

900 4/23/04	OPEN	When a non-top view in a pile is selected, the

901 9/2/04	OPEN	'Flip' button in mapping dialog flips the views but
			doesn't update the info in the dialog (!). (wenger)

902 9/10/04	FIXED	Setting the width and height of a segment to 1000
			makes it disappear from the view (see Test/bug902.ds).
			(wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 1/3/05.)

903 9/13/04	OPEN	If you have an unlinked pile with axes turned on,
			and the two views have different visual filters,
			the axes shown doen't correspond to the view that's
			on top (see Test/bug903.ds). (wenger)  (Also happens
			in the JavaScreen.)

904 9/25/04	OPEN	JavaScreen: cursor display/axis label formats display

			digits; %.nf *doesn't* always display n digits after
			the decimal point. (wenger)

905 10/11/04	FIXED	JavaScreen: text redrawing problem in child views.
			Open the session test/bug905.ds (in the JS demo
			area, move the cursor -> text drawn in the JS
			disappears! (wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 1/4/05.)

906 10/13/04	OPEN	Line color for average, etc, seems to *not* be the
			view foreground color -- it seems to have some
			automatic dependence on the view background color
			(e.g., if background is black stats lines are white
			no matter what the foreground is).  (The stats stuff
			should have its own color anyhow.) (wenger)

907 10/13/04	OPEN	JavaScreen: If you have a view with a cursor, and
			that view is sitting on top of another view (but
			not piled), you can't move the cursor in the JS.
			(This is from the CSR2 vis.) (wenger)

908 10/25/04	OPEN	JavaScreen: in a session with 3D view(s) with
			segments, for some reason rotating the object
			is slower with fewer segments(!!).  (See
			bmrb/4096_side3h.ds for example -- select fewer
			residues and then rotate.) (wenger)

909 11/8/04	OPEN	JavaScreen: axis label text overwrites view help if
			they overlap. (wenger)

910 12/17/04	OPEN	JavaScreen: entering screen size sometimes doesn't
			work (with JSB?).  It should either work or be
			clearer that it's not changeable. (miron/wenger)

911 1/3/05	FIXED	DEVise fails kind of mysteriously to open a session
			file if it's DOS-format text. (wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 1/3/05.)

912 1/3/05	OPEN	DEVise (at least sometimes) treats a socket write
			that writes fewer than the requested bytes as a
			total failure (this may be goofing up the JavaScreen
			sometimes). (wenger)

913 2/15/05	FIXED	Applying in the mapping GUI erases GData attributes
			10-14 (outside the GUI) in the mapping. (wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 2/16/05.)

914 2/16/05	FIXED	'Select Next in Pile' doesn't work on 3D views.
			(wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 2/16/05.)

915 3/16/05	WORK	Condor weekly view session comes up with incorrect
			visual filters (piled views have different filters,
			etc.).  (See the demo session test/bug915.ds.)
			(Note: workaround now in the script that generates
			the session.) (wenger)

916 10/19/05	FIXED	There are still problems with segments disappearing
			when you zoom in too far (see Test/bug916.ds, also
			see bug 902). (wenger)
			(Hmm -- this is fixed in the code in CVS, but not
			in the 1.7.19 that's currently released.)

917 11/2/05	~FIXED	Drill-down doesn't seem to work right on text labels
			(at least when piled).  (See Test/bug917.ds -- you
			seem to have to hit the text symbol to the exact
			pixel to get it instead of one of the lines.)
			(wenger)

918 11/28/05	NB	Axis tick and data don't always match up when they
			should (see Test/bug918.ds). (wenger)

919 12/19/05	DUP	Drill-down works really poorly on text (seems like
			DEVise treats it as a one-pixel-sized symbol in
			terms of hitting the right place).  For example,
			drill down on the text residue list in the Pistachio
			visualization template.  (wenger)
			(Duplicate of 917.)

920 4/3/06	OPEN	3D drill-down only works for collaboration leaders
			(bug in previous fix to avoid sending extra commands
			if you're not a collaboration leader). (wenger)

921 4/3/06	OPEN	View help doesn't work in Jmol views. (wenger)

922 7/12/06	OPEN	When you set a link multiplication factor in the
			GUI, it doesn't immediately take effect (you have
			to change the visual filter of one of the views first).
			(wenger)

923 9/22/06	OPEN	If a view is excluded from printing, but has "send
			GData to JS" set to true, DEVise still sends the
			associated GData, which of course confuses the JS.
			(wenger)

924 9/22/06	OPEN	If a view is excluded from printing, but has a
			cursor in it, DEVise still tells the JS to draw
			the cursor, which of course confuses it. (wenger)

925 9/22/06	OPEN	Print modes don't work for Jmol view. (wenger)

926 11/22/06	OPEN	JS: hiding and re-showing the Jmol selection tree
			window resets the selection to the defaults. (wenger)

927 11/29/06	FIXED	JS/Jmol: double-clicking on an atom to enter distance
			measurement mode also drills down. (wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 11/30/06.)

928 11/30/06	OPEN	JS/Jmol: ideally, drill-down should happen only on
			shift-click, to match the rest of the JS. (wenger)

929 12/4/06	FIXED	Drill-down on a view having a data source for which
			the file is empty or non-existant causes a core
			dump. (See BMRB histogram sessions, Bug929*.ds.)
			(wenger)
			(Fixed in V1_8b0_br by wenger, 12/7/06.)

930 12/7/06	CLOSED	JS: drill-down on the BMRB histogram sessions only
			shows data from one view in the pile; when drilling
			down in DEVise itself, data from both views is shown.
			(wenger)
			(Tried to reproduce this on 12/8/06, unable to.)
			(Hmm -- this shows up at BMRB -- is it a function of
			the server being 1.9.0 instead of 1.9.1?  Or maybe
			the different data?)
			(Okay, the problem is that if you don't actually
			click on the bar, you don't see the data for the
			bar itself, just the link data.)

931 12/7/06	DUP	JS/Jmol: change selection trees; close the selection
			tree window; re-show the selection trees->the
			selection is reset to the default. (wenger)
			(See also 926.)

932 12/7/06	FIXED	Axis multiplication factor doesn't get copied when
			copying a view (DEVise 1.9.0) (maybe fixed in 1.9.1?).
			(wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 12/8/06.)

933 1/30/06	OPEN	JS/DEVise: JS shows 4096acdd as a session file.
			(wenger)

934 2/23/06	OPEN	JS/Jmol: the Jmol view sometimes shows the "busy"
			mouse cursor when it shouldn't. (wenger)

935 3/30/06	OPEN	JS: (non-Jmol) 3D drill down doesn't do anything
			unless you're a collaboration leader (my fix for
			that was wrong).  Also, if you *are* a collaboration
			leader, I don't see how you ever send a command to
			the followers for a 3D drill-down, because there's
			a return statement right after the drillDown3D() call.
			(wenger) (fix on 1.8 branch)

936 5/11/06	OPEN	JS: F1 key to see view help doesn't work consistently
			in Firefox. (wenger)

937 1/17/07	OPEN	In the BMRB 3D visualization, the cursor in the data
			view *sometimes* changes its X range when you change
			to a different data set. (wenger).

938 6/27/06	OPEN	JS/Jmol: things like whether you are showing the
			bounding box get reset if you select a different
			set of atoms to *display*.  (Changing what's
			*highlighted* is okay.) (wenger)

939 2/21/07	~FIXED	JavaScreen: if you're doing a rubberband line to
			zoom in, and the mouse goes into the axis area of
			the view, you end up zooming out slightly. (wenger)
			(Actually, this happens in non-JS DEVise, too.)
			(Workaround in JS client implemented by wenger,
			9/25/08.)

940 4/10/07	OPEN	JS/Jmol: open Jmol session; close tree selection
			window; move the cursor in the data view -> JS
			locks up. (elu)

941 6/7/07	FIXED	JavaScreen:  apparently has problems on Windows Vista
			and/or Java 1.6.  (See notes from talking with Eiichi,
			also email to devise-sup from Manoj Kumar.)  (wenger)
			(Marked fixed by wenger, 2/7/08.  The users who
			reported this are now saying that it works okay.)

942 6/28/07	FIXED?	JS:  in JSA and stand-alone application, toolbar
			tooltips are obscured by the DEViseScreen panel.
			(The fix is changing the DEViseScreen to a JPanel;
			the only question at this point is whether the
			resulting lockups are fixed.)
			(wenger)

943 6/28/07	OPEN	JS/Jmol:  toolbar modes (e.g., show help) don't work
			yet in Jmol views (except for drill-down).
			(wenger)

944 6/28/07	OPEN	JS:  3D toolbar modes don't work yet (for either
			Jmol or "old" 3D views).
			(wenger)
		
945 6/28/07	FIXED	JS:  mouse cursor is not yet changed according to
			toolbar mode.  (wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 8/3/07.)

946 6/28/07	FIXED	JS:  when in one of the toolbar zoom modes, the
			JS should still zoom (as opposed to moving resizing
			the cursor) even if you're on a cursor.  (wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, ?/?/07.)

947 10/22/07	OPEN	JS:  open the JS demo session test/2cursors.ds,
			do "expand cursor" in the main view -- only one
			cursor is correctly drawn. (wenger)

948 10/22/07	OPEN	Doing "C"/"expand cursor" in a view with multiple
			cursors should probably expand all of the cursors.
			(wenger)

949 10/23/07	OPEN	JS:  only allows one level of parent/child views
			(DEVise itself allows an arbitrary number of layers.)
			(wenger)  (See JS sessions test/parent_child_3.ds
			and test/parent_child_4.ds.)

950 10/29/07	OPEN	Saving a session to a file that's a symlink breaks
			the link. (wenger)

951 10/31/07	OPEN	Black/white mode problems with BMRB histogram sessions:
			use the View->Display menu option to change mode to
			black-and-white; exercise the screen so it has to
			draw something (e.g., move one of the cursors); use 
			the View->Display menu option to change mode from
			black-and-white back to normal -> now the whole graph
			is black and you can't see a thing.
			(madings/wenger)
			(I'm not sure whether this is something that can
			be fixed in the sessions or whether it will take
			a fix to DEVise itself -- wenger 071031.)

952 10/31/07	OPEN	JS: eventually locked up browser with
			Linux/Firefox/JRE1.5.1 setup (playing around with
			color modes, although I doubt that has anything to
			do with it). (madings/wenger)

953 10/31/07	OPEN	Destroying a view does not destroy the corresponding
			mapping. (wenger)

954 11/16/07	FIXED	JavaScreen locks up IE for Miron:  go to BMRB
			visualization, then try to go to a different URL,
			and the browser locks up. (This is in IE/WinXP.)
			Doesn't have to be a Jmol visualization.  Miron says
			this started after upgrading his Java version.
			(miron/wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 1/22/07, in JS 5.8.2.1 on
			js_ie_fix_br branch.)

955 12/28/07	OPEN	Count mappings get goofed up if you zoom in too much
			in the count axis (e.g., if you zoom in too much on
			the Y axis in the CSR 1 visualizations, all of the
			bars disappear). (wenger)

956 1/23/08	FIXED	JS: bmrb/4096_3d_jmol.html visualization doesn't
			'react correctly to changes in a "selector"'
			(needs clarification). (miron/wenger)
			(JS 5.8.2.1.)
			Okay, this bug is not unique to JS 5.8.2.1; in fact,
			I think it's probably actually a bug in DEVise itself
			or maybe in how the session is set up.  Anyhow, here's
			the bug: expand the cursor in the data view to the full
			size of the view; then decrease the size of the cursor
			in the data zoom view.  This should reduce the size
			of the cursor in the data view to match the new view
			size (which would also select fewer atoms in the 3D
			view), but it doesn't.  Hmm -- this might have
			something to do with the use of highlight views.
			(Fixed by wenger, 1/25/08, in Peptide-CGI 11.2.2.)

957 2/13/08	OPEN	JS: Jmol->View Selection Trees does not bring the
			tree window to the front or deiconify it on
			RHEL5/Gnome.  (It still shows it if it's destroyed.)
			(wenger)

958 2/15/08	OPEN	JS: view help dialog should come up closer to the
			click location. (wenger)

959 2/15/08	OPEN	JS: cannot show view help by clicking in a view's
			title area. (wenger)

960 2/22/08	FIXED	JS: in default toolbar mode, JS shows a noop cursor
			when not on the DEVise cursor in the bottom (atom
			selection) view of the chem shift ref 1 visualization.
			(It shouldn't show the noop cursor because clicking
			will move the DEVise cursor.) (wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 9/9/09.)

961 2/22/08	OPEN	JS?: in the chem shift ref 1 visualization, a brown
			border shows up around the main view after zooming
			in that view (for 4317 on teal, at least). (wenger)
			Hmm -- this seems to be related to something on
			the server side (maybe Xvfb version??) -- when I
			connect to teal with JS client 5.9.0x6 I see the
			problem; when I connect to marlin I don't (both
			DEVise 1.9.0 Jul 13 2006).

962 2/22/08	FIXED	JS: help needs change -- you need to be in toolbar
			drill-down mode for drill-down to work in Jmol
			views. (wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 3/5/08.)

963 2/22/08	OPEN	JS: JavaScreen release should include the jsj
			script so you can test run the client application
			in the release directory. (wenger)

964 3/5/08	OPEN	JS: in DNA or RNA histograms -- shift-click produced
			a drill-down dialog, but seemed to never actually
			find the data; drilling down with the toolbar worked
			okay (even though both seemed to produce the same
			commands). (elu/wenger)

965 3/5/08	FIXED	JS: user confusion caused by JS not seeing all
			shift-key-up events and therefore zooming out instead
			of in, etc.  Therefore, disable shift as a keyboard
			modifier in the JS (and maybe other things that could
			cause problems). (elu/wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 3/5/08.)

966 3/5/08	OPEN	JS: when doing drill-down on histogram visualizations,
			for Eldon, at least, the popped-up browser tab/page is
			unresponsive while the drill-down dialog is shown.
			(elu/wenger)

967 3/5/08	OPEN	JS: on DNA/RNA histograms, sometimes finding only
			the link data and not the "real" data. (elu/wenger)

968 7/15/08	~OPEN	JS: if a cursor goes entirely outside of the visual
			filter of its destination view, you can't move the
			cursor by clicking in the view. (wenger)
			(Mostly fixed by wenger, 7/15/08.  See notes in
			DEViseView.java.)

969 7/15/08	OPEN	If a cursor is entirely outside of the destination
			view's visual filter, maybe doing 'C' (cursor fill) 
			in the destination view should move the cursor into
			the visual filter, even if resizing of the cursor
			is not allowed. (wenger)

970 8/19/08	OPEN	JS: if the screensize is 600x400 (for example), the
			top items in the toolbar aren't shown after a session
			is opened. (wenger)  (Hmm -- seems like this only
			happens if the session is passed as a command-line
			argument; this is stand-alone JS, not the applet.)

971 9/4/08	OPEN	Go to BMRB histogram visualization; then follow
			the 'large visualization' link, and interact with
			the applet -> Firefox locks up (not every time,
			though).  (dmiller1/wenger)

972 9/19/08	ACTIVE	JS: it's not easy/obvious enough how to get the JS
			back into the default toolbar mode once you've
			switched.  (Maybe a partial solution is that <esc>
			gets you back into the default mode?)  (Also make
			the default button more prominent?  Make it look
			more like the associated mouse cursor?) (miron/wenger)

973 9/19/08	FIXED?	JS: sometimes it's too hard to tell that a mouse
			click (or whatever) did something (e.g., when "home"
			on a view doesn't change the visual filter).  (Maybe
			put a minimum on the amount of time the Stop button
			is red?) (miron/wenger)
			(Fixed? by wenger, 9/24/08 -- added delay.)

974 9/22/08	OPEN	JS: collaboration doesn't work for Jmol sessions.
			(wenger)

975 5/19/09	OPEN	JS: it looks like we re-draw the entire view each
			time a cursor is dragged.  If so, we should avoid
			that!  (wenger)

976 6/1/09	OPEN	Something in devise.ldemo still expects a /p/devise.
			(maziuk/wenger)

977 6/23/09	OPEN	If a session file is a symbolic link, saving the
			session breaks the link. (wenger)

978 8/26/09	FIXED	JS: in Firefox/Windows Vista (on glandon, at least)
			the coordinates the JavaScreen gets doesn't match
			where the mouse cursor is drawn (draw a zoom box
			to see this). (wenger)  (Seems like the problem is
			with the cursor hot spot.  wenger 9/2/09.)  (Okay,
			the problem is that the cursor image is actually
			drawn double-size for some reason, which throws off
			the cursor hot spot.)
			(Fixed by wenger, 9/3/09.)

979 8/26/09	OPEN	JS: in Firefox/Windows Vista (on glandon, at least)
			the drill-down dialog doesn't expand according to the
			length of the strings that are displayed. (wenger)

980 8/28/09	OPEN	JS: go to a web page with the JavaScreen, quit
			browser, you get a null pointer error (at least in
			IE): (wenger)

981 9/4/09	PART	JS: numbers should be right-justified in drill-
			down dialog. (miron/wenger)
			(Partially fixed by wenger, 9/4/09.)

982 9/4/09	FIXED	JS: mouse cursor is large and ugly on Windows.
			(miron/wenger)  (Maybe create a 32x32 cursor
			image, and see if Windows displays that at the
			original size instead of doubling it.)
			(Fixed by wenger, 9/9/09.)

983 9/9/09	FIXED	JS: when in "expand cursor" toolbar mode, the "expand
			cursor" mouse cursor shows up even when you're on
			a view that doesn't have any DEVise cursors. (wenger)
			(Fixed by wenger, 9/9/09.)
