--- --------    ------  -------------------------------------------------------
001 05/14/96	OPEN	There are a number of memory leaks. (rkw)
			(Most of these have been fixed -- at least the big
			ones.  rkw 10/15/96)
			Assigned: Guangshun

002 05/14/96	FIXED	DEVise hogs an awful lot of CPU cycles even when
			you are not doing anything. (rkw/kb) (jpm)

003 05/14/96	FIXED	Numeric keypad keys don't always work correctly
			on Suns running SunOS 4.x. (rkw)

004 05/16/96	FIXED   Physical schema editor does not support the length
			parameter of string attribute types. (jpm)

005 05/16/96	OPEN	Physical schema editor does not support multi-word
			high-low values (e.g. 'Jan 1 1990 00:00:00'). (jpm)
			Deferred

006 05/16/96	OPEN	Date attribute type cannot handle dates before
			Jan 1 1970 (Unix zero time value). (jpm)
			Deferred

007 05/16/96	FIXED	Kiviat graph cannot be destroyed once created.
			Destroying it through the window manager causes
			Devise to crash. (jpm)

008 05/16/96	FIXED	View window cannot be destroyed through the
			window manager causes Devise to crash. (jpm)

009 05/22/96	FIXED	OBJ in generic/Makefile.base doesn't get the
			right list; causes 'make clean' to try to delete
			source files. (rkw)

010 05/31/96	OPEN	In TDataMap.c, call to ConvertToGData with _tmpPtr
			as argument may not be work correctly (alignment of
			_tmpPtr). (rkw)
			Deferred

011 06/06/96	CD	DEVise doesn't deal well with bar charts where data
			is all zeros -- sometimes crashes. (rkw)

012 06/06/96	OPEN	All TData's ever used in a session get saved, even
			if they're no longer used. (rkw)
			Deferred

013 07/10/96	FIXED	Schema editing code doesn't seem to recognize comment
			lines in the schema files -- tries to interpret them
			as attributes. (rkw)

014 07/11/96	FIXED   Schema editor doesn't allow entry of string lengths
			(always forces them to 10). (rkw) (duplicate of 004)

015 07/11/96	FIXED	HP version of Devise can't open the condorview1.tk
			session. (rkw)

016 07/31/96	OPEN	Catalog system is type unsafe. (kb/rkw)
			Deferred

			off. (rkw)

018 08/05/96	FIXED	Data segment stuff is broken. (rkw)

019 08/05/96	CD	demo/COD1.tk core dumps (at least on HPs). (rkw)

020 08/05/96	FIXED	Numeric keypad keys only work in solaris version? (rkw)

021 08/05/96	FIXED	'5' key doesn't work. (rkw)

022 08/06/96	FIXED?	Records missing from view when many views or 
			datasources are open. (kb)

023 08/04/96	FIXED?	Doing an extreme zoom in causes extra records to 
			suddenly appear. (kb)
			9/6/96: cause of problem found:
			Overflow problem when converting from devise
			coordinates (double) to X coordinates (short).
			See XWindowRep::FillRectArray for one possible
			solution which works for rectangles, but it won't
			quite right work for other types (eg lines).
			(Possible fix by rkw, 11/12/99 -- see
			XWindowRep::Line().)

024 08/06/96	OPEN	Zooming as far as you can in or out can cause 
			DEVise to fail an assertion. (kb)
			Deferred

025 08/07/96	OPEN	Keypad '5' doesn't work when num lock is off. (rkw)
			Deferred

026 08/07/96	OPEN	On HP and SPARC/SunOS, keypad keys only work when
			num lock is on. (rkw)
			Deferred

027 08/09/96	FIXED	Load demo/colors.tk, scroll; load demo/3d_test.tk,
			scroll -> core dump (only on SPARC/Solaris?). (rkw)

028 08/12/96	FIXED	Overlays don't work (see LandsEnd/a2.tk). (ml/rkw)

029 08/13/96	FIXED	Splitting and re-merging views corrupts data. (rkw)

030 08/13/96	FIXED	A view continuously redraws itself while it's
			iconified. (rkw)

031 08/15/96	FIXED	Rotation of stacked views doesn't seem to work. (rkw)

032 08/15/96	FIXED	After removing a view from a window, the remaining
			views aren't redrawn until you click in that window.
			(rkw)

033 08/23/96	FIXED	Run LandsEnd/test.tk -- one view doesn't draw
			correctly (because of links). (ssl/rkw)

034 08/28/96	FIXED	Run Dali1.tk without specifying Dali server ->
			core dump. (kb/rkw)

035 08/29/96	OPEN	Files in temp and work directories don't get
			cleaned up. (ssl/rkw)
			(Actually, the temp directory gets cleaned up if
			Devise exits normally.) (rkw 8/30/96)
			Deferred

036 08/30/96	FIXED	Run LandsEnd/a2.tk session with client/server
			Devise -> crashes (assertion fails in View.c). (rkw)

037 09/04/96	FIXED	Set X in mapping to a constant -> core dump. (rkw)

038 09/05/96	FIXED	'Not Supported Yet' window needs an 'OK' button.
			(rkw)

039 09/12/96	FIXED	+/- keys don't change symbol sizes. (ml/rkw)

040 09/13/96	FIXED	+/- keys seem to only work on one view of piled/
			stacked views (see LandsEnd/a2.tk). (rkw)
			Deferred

041 09/16/96	FIXED	If you change the X mapping between a date attribute
			and an attribute of another type, the axis labels
			aren't correctly updated until the session is saved
			and re-opened. (rkw)
			Fixed by RKW, 1998-12-22.

042 09/19/96	FIXED	Devise doesn't complain if you give an illegal
			command line option. (rkw)

043 09/24/96	FIXED	XWindowRep, PSWindowRep don't always check that they
			aren't overflowing points, rectAngles arrays. (rkw)

044 09/25/96	FIXED	GDataBin objects take way too much memory (256K
			for Connectors). (rkw)

045 10/07/96	FIXED   User can't enter a tab for a separator in the
			schema editing window. (rkw)

046 10/07/96	WORK	Create a window with the same name as a data stream
			-> crash. (rkw)  (This is a consequence of bug 016.)
			(Workaround implemented: ClassDir exits if a duplicate
			name is added. rkw 10/15/96)

047 10/08/96	FIXED	Load /p/devise/wenger/session/hourstats.tk, iconify
			the window -> crash. (rkw)

048 10/09/96	FIXED	Devise core dumps if data file named in catalog
			does not exist. (rkw)

049 10/11/96	OPEN	Load MailOrder/a2_full.tk session -- DEVISE_TMP
			directory gets huge amounts of stuff written to it.
			(Running with '-convert 0' flag prevents this.) (rkw)
			(Also, DEVise eventually crashes if the partition
			gets filled up.)
			Deferred

050 10/14/96	FIXED	Setting a GData attribute to recid does not work
			correctly (if it's already set it's okay, but
			setting it doesn't work). (rkw)

051 10/15/96    FIXED	Showing statistics as text produces many errors. (rkw)

052 10/16/96	FIXED	When importing a data stream (particularly when
			mapping recId to X) xlow sometimes comes up
			greater than xhigh. (rkw)

053 10/21/96	OPEN	You run out of available file descriptors if you
			have too many GDatas. (rkw)
			(Workaround: doesn't open GData files if '-convert 0'
			is specified on the command line.)
			Deferred

054 10/22/96    FIXED   Tcl error when defining visualization on a data
                        file that has one record. Reason: incr does not
                        work on floating-point numbers. (jpm)

055 10/22/96	FIXED	You can't find the name (not title) of a view from
			the GUI. (rkw)

056 10/24/96	OPEN	Too hard to hit the middle of boxes to display
			record data. (rkw)
			Deferred

057 10/24/96	CD	When you switch the layout of a window (e.g., vertical
			to horizontal) the window often is not redrawn. (rkw)

058 10/29/96	FIXED	Changing line width doesn't work in direct PostScript.
			(rkw)

059 11/05/96	OPEN	Keyboard callback function for SGI version of client/
			server library doesn't work. (rkw/na)
			Deferred

060 11/05/96	OPEN	WinServer's HandleButton(..) callback routine
			in client/server library can't handle continuous
			calls (holding down mouse button). (rkw/na)
			Deferred

061 11/11/96    FIXED   GData is never cached in memory! Found bug in
                        TData.h: int RecSize() somehow no longer virtual
                        as it should be. (jpm)

062 11/08/96	FIXED	Don't ask whether you want to close a session when
			there is no session open (e.g., immediately after
			starting devise). (ml/rkw)

063 11/12/96	WORK	Devise core dumps when trying to parse a schema
			with a string attribute that's missing the length.
			(rkw)
			(Workaround: assertion fails.)

064 11/14/96	FIXED	Load session test/miron_new.tk; pile the views in
			DEViseWn1, and flip the pile -> the view is drawn
			only when one of the three views is on top. (ml/
			rkw)

065 11/14/96	CD  	Load session test/dcb1.tk; the data in the 'Log
			Display' window is not drawn, even though a point
			query indicates that the data is there. (rkw/kb)

066 11/14/96	CD	Load session test/dbc1.tk; decrease the size of
			the symbols in the 'RunTime vs. ExecTime' view
			with the '-' key -> symbols change to single pixels
			much too soon. (rkw)

067 11/14/96	CD	Load session test/DBC.tk; in view 'Restarts vs.
			ExecTime', the whole view within the axes is filled
			in with a kind of maroon color. Problem does
                        not seem to exist any longer. (rkw/jpm)

068 11/14/96	FIXED	Exporting a session with data doesn't seem to work
			if there is more than one data source (export
			appears to work, but subsequent open fails).  (See
			session test/miron_new_wdata.tk.) (rkw)

069 11/14/96	OPEN	Load session test/dbc2.tk; most views are initially
			drawn with incorrect colors.  This somehow fixes
			itself if you force a redraw (resize windows, etc.).
			Problem does not seem to exist any longer.  Perhaps
			the saved pixmaps just got goofed up. (rkw/jpm)

070 11/14/96	CD/NB?	Load session test/dbc2.tk; toggling axes does not
			work correctly. Problem does not seem to exist
                        any longer. Perhaps this was not really a problem
                        in the first place? (jpm)
			(See also bug 110.)

071 11/18/96	FIXED	In piled views with axes, the data from non-"top"
			views sometimes overdraws the X axis and is drawn
			to the left of the Y axis. (rkw/jpm)
			(See also bug 098.)

072 11/19/96	FIXED	(With multi) Open test/multidemo2.tk, close it ->
			core dump (at least on HP and SPARC/Solaris). (rkw)

073 11/19/96	FIXED	Hit connector key ('c') on a scatter plot ->
			internal error. (ml/rkw)

074 11/19/96	FIXED	Data in view shouldn't be redrawn when you change
			the view title. (ml/rkw)

075 11/19/96	FIXED	If there's no view title, the Y axis (if any) is
			not displayed correctly. (rkw)

076 11/20/96	OPEN	'Child windows should have been destroyed first' error
			message (don't know exactly how to reproduce this).
			(rr/rkw)
			Deferred

077 11/21/96	FIXED	Importing data into a window with piled views
			doesn't work correctly -- new view gets put into
			window but is not visible unless views are unpiled.
			(rkw)

078 11/21/96	FIXED	Open a template as a session, cancel out of selecting
			a data stream -> some of the (internal) objects for
			the session are not destroyed (opening the same
			session again causes duplicate name error). (rkw)

079 11/21/96	OPEN	Data shouldn't be erased when switching from display
			to layout mode. (ml/rkw)
			Deferred

080 11/21/96	OPEN	'Working' should be shown while drilling down as
			the result of a middle button click. (ml/rkw)
			Deferred

081 11/22/96	FIXED	Derived data histograms not always working (see
			the session test/sales1.tk, must be on tiger to
			use this). (ml/rkw)
			(Histograms not supported on scatter plots yet.)

082 11/25/96	FIXED	Load session test/a2.tk -> core dump. (rkw/jpm)

083 11/25/96	FIXED	Printing directly to a printer doesn't work. (rkw)

084 11/25/96	FIXED	Temporary print file isn't removed after printing.
			(rkw)

085 11/26/96	FIXED	Record links to window with map not working right in
			session test/a2.tk (_all_ records are initially
			drawn; then if you force a redraw, only the correct
			ones are drawn). (rkw)

086 11/27/96	CD	Can't print session wenger/session/PrintTest6.tk
			(never finishes). (rkw)

087 12/02/96	FIXED	Removing a view causes DEVise to exit. (rkw)

088 12/02/96	FIXED	If you click on a view to select it while data is
			being drawn, the XOR'ing of the selection box gets
			goofed up. (ssl/rkw)

089 12/03/96	FIXED	PostScript bounding box does not fit tightly around
			the image. (ml/rkw)

090 12/03/96	FIXED	Load session test/MM1System.tk, print to PostScript;
			'Pwi' text comes out at wrong place. (ml/rkw)

091 12/03/96	FIXED	Print all windows to PostScript with more than one
			window -> core dump. (ml/rkw)

092 12/04/96	CD	Load session test/MM1System.tk -> lowest label on
			Y axis is a very small number instead of zero.
			Problem does not seem to exist any longer. (ml/rkw)

093 12/04/96	FIXED	Opening a statistics view from any other view causes
                        a core dump.  (Load session demo/colors.tk, and then
                        open the histogram view).  The believed cause is the
                        TData detects a change in the data and then cancels
                        all queries on it, but the QP still has a pointer
                        to the current qdata (which was deleted by the cancel)
                        and tries to continue processing the query.

094 12/06/96	FIXED	Linux version won't run because of an error in the
			shared memory code. (rkw)

095 12/16/96	FIXED	'OK' button in mapping editor doesn't work. (rkw)

096 12/16/96	CD	Can't display histograms at all -- you get 'invalid
			command name "findNumericCaseValue"' from Tcl/Tk.
			(rkw)

097 12/16/96	FIXED	'Duplicate window' should make an entirely separate
			copy of the window -- changing mappings, etc., in
			one window should not affect the other one. (ml/rkw)

098 12/16/96	FIXED	Load session test/molbio_demo.tk -> clip mask doesn't
			work on two of three piled views. (rkw/jpm)
			(This is a specific instance of bug 071.)

099 12/16/96	NB	Load session test/molbio_demo.tk -> zooming doesn't
			work correctly (sometimes zooms in X and Y when it
			should zoom only in X). (rkw)
                        Session didn't mark time attr as sorted, so the
                        system thought the view must be a scatter plot,
                        regardless of the symbol type (a line).
                        Perhaps this behavior should be modified. (kb)

100 12/16/96	OPEN	If you import data into several windows and specify
			that there should be an X link, _all_ views are
			linked to a single link; it would probably be better
			to have each window have its own X link. (ml/rkw)
			Deferred

101 12/16/96	FIXED	'5' key sometimes doesn't work correctly (for example,
			load the session test/bad5key.tk). (ml/rkw)
                        Cause: recIds don't have hi/lo values.
                        Technical cause: recIds don't have AttrInfo in
                        the TData, (ie, map->MapGAttr2TAttr(MappingCmd_X)
                        returns NULL when X is mapped to recId).
			(Fixed by rkw, 10/20/98.)

102 12/17/96	OPEN	Control-c doesn't seem to be able to terminate
			Devise if you have an input-grabbing Tk dialog
			open. (rkw)
			Deferred

103 12/20/96	FIXED	Bold, italic, and New Century Schoolbook fonts
			don't work in PostScript. (rkw)

104 12/23/96	FIXED	AttrProj::LastRecId should report an error when
			called on TData that doesn't have an index.  (rkw)

105 12/26/96	FIXED	Print a view with a non-white background to
			PostScript -> there are "stripes" where white shows
			through because the various background areas don't
			quite touch each other. (rkw)

106 12/30/96	FIXED	Load the session test/a2.tk; you get the following
			error: DEVise error: RangeList::Insert() recId 4,4
			already processed at
			../../graphics.new/RangeList.c: 219. (It doesn't
        		matter whether or not you're using shared memory.)
                        (rkw/jpm)

107 01/06/97	OPEN	If you have more than 19 views, those views are
			named 'View 110', 'View 111', etc., instead of
			'View 20', etc. (rkw)
			Deferred

108 01/09/97	FIXED	Load the session /p/devise/session/test/jussitape.tk,
			print to PostScript -> some of the text comes out at
			the wrong place. (jpm/rkw)

109 01/09/97	CD  	Load the session /p/devise/test/baa1.tk, select the
			view in window DEViseWn1, bring up the Query Tool ->
			the axis limits are not filled in. (rkw/kb)

110 01/09/97	NB	Load the session /p/devise/test/baa1.tk, select the
			view in window DEViseWn1 -> you can't display
			axes in this view. Not a bug: foreground color
                        was the same as background color, so axes just
                        weren't visible. (rkw/jpm)

111 01/10/97	OPEN	Got the following bug when loading the session
			/p/devise/session/demo/COD1.tk, only with shared
			memory, and only (but consistently) on the HP
			architecture: An internal error has occurred. The
			reason is: Inconsistent state
			(../../graphics.new/TDataAscii.c:824). (rkw)
			Deferred

112 01/10/97	FIXED	If a fatal error occurs while running with shared
			memory, you need to manually kill off processes
			to clean up. (rkw/jpm)

113 01/10/97	OPEN	Devise does not clean up shared memory resources
			if it crashes. (rkw)
			Deferred

114 01/10/97	FIXED	Load session /p/devise/session/test/baa1.tk, select
			view 'Location 1 Visits', print -> the data in the
			'BAA.am' view doesn't get printed.

115 01/13/97	FIXED?	Load session test/molbio_demo.tk
                        XY zoom with mouse (button 3) produces what looks
                        like an X zoom and you must hit button '5' twice
                        to get the proper filter.
                        The cause is that the views are both X linked on
                        time and XY linked with the pile link.  To fix this
                        bug, the system needs to understand its links
                        better.  I think Shilpa's work should address this.
                        (kb)
			Deferred

116 01/13/97	FIXED	Load session /p/devise/session/test/birch.tk ->
			assertion fails indicating that points array
			in XWindowRep will overflow. (rkw)

117 01/14/97	OPEN	There are a number of places that variations on
			'records per batch' are independently defined to
			1024.  It looks like these must all be the same
			size and therefore should be defined in a single
			place. (rkw)
			Deferred

118 01/14/97	OPEN    Makefile couldn't find my.yacc.tab.h when making
			DEVise in dir like /p/devise/guangshu/test/solsparc
			(gc)
			Deferred

119 01/15/97	OPEN	If you have too many attributes, the 'Select X'
			menu in the 'Define Visualization' dialog goes
			off the bottom of the screen (ma/rkw)
			Deferred

120 01/15/97	OPEN	DTE/Makefile.base duplicates much of
			devread/Makefile.base. (rkw)
			Deferred

121 01/16/97	FIXED	Assertion 'color < Instance()->_numColors' in
			ColorMgr::GetColorRgb() failed when printing
			PostScript.  (Doesn't seem to be repeatable.) (rkw)

122 01/16/97	FIXED	Changing mapping (forcing data to be redrawn) goofs
			up the drawing of the view selection box. (rkw)
			(Setting FILL_WHOLE_BACKGROUND to 0 in View.c
			removed the fix for this bug.  rkw)

123 01/16/97	WORK	Load the sesson demo/COD1.tk; resize the 'Global
			View' window; then obscure any part of that window
			by raising another window -> the data area of the
			'Global View' window gets erased.  (Because the
			window is erroneously receiving an Expose event
			instead of the VisibilityNotify event it should
			be getting.) (rkw)
			Note: this bug shows up with fvwm but not with twm,
			tvtwm, or mwm.
			(Workaround in View::HandleExpose().)

124 01/17/97	FIXED	Drawing of the selection box gets goofed up if the
			actual data overdraws it. (rkw)

125 01/22/97	FIXED	When the help window is shown, the topics do not show
			up. (rkw)

126 01/22/97	FIXED	When views are unstacked, they're not always redrawn
			correctly. (rkw)

127 01/22/97	WORK	'Attributes' and 'Colors' buttons in Query Tool do
			nothing. (rkw)
			Workaround: removed the buttons.

128 01/22/97	FIXED	If you change both the X and Y values in the Query
			Tool on a view with X and Y links, only the X change
			takes effect. (rkw)
			Deferred

469 03/15/99	FIXED	'5' (home) key doesn't work right in views that are

490 05/18/99	FIXED	If a session contains piled views containing view
			symbols, closing the session or destroying a window
			may cause DEVise to crash (for example, in Tim
			Wilson's FullDaily3.ds session). (tw/rkw)
			(This is caused by a view symbol's X window being

491 05/18/99	FIXED	Duplicate elimination doesn't work properly for the

565 02/21/00	FIXED	JavaScreen has "Invalid image data for view" errors
			with bmrb/4096_backbone_var.ds session when jspop

			(Fixed by Hongyu, 3/6/00.)

566 02/21/00	FIXED	Jss can't restart a devised if the jspop and jss

			(Fixed by Hongyu, 2/23/00.)

567 02/23/00	FIXED	Load FamMed_pre_post_natal.ds in the JavaScreen,

			(hy/rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 2/23/00.)

568 03/06/00	FIXED	Load Misc/COD1.ds in the JavaScreen -- the devised

			(Fixed by rkw, 3/8/00.)

			(Fixed by rkw, 3/13/00.)

			TDataAsciiInterpClassInfo::CreateWithParams() are
			probably leaked. (rkw)

574 03/15/00	FIXED	Open SoilSci/Asos.ds, close it -> failed assertion
			in View::SetPileMode(). (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 3/15/00.)

575 03/23/00	OPEN	Either pixmaps or the code that gets the images
			from them does not work with the latest version
			of XFree86. (rkw)
			(See also 584.)

576 03/28/00	OPEN	Various columns in link/cursor info dialog can
			be scrolled separately (with arrow keys). (oz/rkw)

577 04/05/00	FIXED	'c' (full cursor) bypasses type (X, Y, or XY) of
			cursor, probably also whether cursor is fixed
			size. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 4/6/00.)

578 04/18/00	OPEN	Displaying a data source from the 'Edit Data Stream
			Definition' dialog doesn't work. (rkw)

580 04/19/00	OPEN	In client/server DEVise, errors don't seem to get
			correctly passed back up to Tcl on the client side.
			(rkw)

581 04/21/00	NB	Monolithic devise won't run without catalog.tcl and
			Querycatalog.tcl even though the devised will. (rkw)
			(Do we even really use these files anymore?)
			(Yes -- they are needed by Tcl GUI for logical

582 04/25/00	FIXED	View help in the JavaScreen doesn't wrap lines. (rkw)
			(Fixed by ven, 7/20/00.)

583 04/27/00	FIXED	Drill-down in the JavaScreen doesn't seem to work

			(Fixed by rkw, 5/3/00.)

584 04/28/00	OPEN	Pixmaps for JavaScreen support don't work right
			with latest X server (Solaris 2.7) (rkw)
			(See also 575.)

			same thing as in "regular" DEVise if part of the
			cursor extends outside of the destination view. (rkw)

589 05/17/00	OPEN	Automatic filter updating in piled views only works
			correctly if the top view in the pile is the one
			with automatic filter updating turned on.   (Otherwise,
			the filters get updated after only the first view
			has been drawn once, so the data information in the
			other views isn't up-to-date.)  (rkw)

590 05/22/00	FIXED	JavaScreen bug: if you do control-drag in a 3D
			view to zoom, and let off the mouse button and
			then drag again, all while holding the control
			key down, the JS "forgets" that you still have
			the control key down when you do the second drag.
			(sm/rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 5/25/00.)

591 05/22/00	OPEN	JavaScreen: shouldn't do repaints so often (just

			pick up keystrokes in 3D views. (rkw)
			(See also bug 592.)

595 06/06/00	FIXED	JavaScreen: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
			when opening AWON session. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 6/6/00.)

596 06/14/00	FIXED	Fixed text based on a fraction of the screen height
			doesn't come out to the same relative size in the
			JavaScreen as in "regular" DEVise. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 6/15/00.)

597 6/14/00	FIXED	Jss doesn't seem to be able to start a devised
			(or maybe the problem is in connecting to the
			jspop) other than when the jss is started. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 6/15/00.)

598 6/15/00     FIXED	JavaScreen: open the bmrb/4096_side3f.ds session,
			move the rightmost cursor a few times ->
			java.lang.OutOfMemoryError. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 6/16/00.)

599 6/20/00	OPEN	If you zoom in too far, especially with a low-
			precision axis format, you can end up with multiple
			axis ticks with identical labels. (rkw)

			talking to the devised, and then 'No' in the
			dialog, the JS still exits. (rkw)

601 7/12/00	OPEN	JavaScreen: JS doesn't get key released event
			while help dialog is shown. (rkw)

602 7/18/00	FIXED	JavaScreen: dragging a cursor doesn't work right
			if the cursor is in the non-base(?) view of a pile
			(see bmrb/test/bad_cursor_drag.ds, third cursor
			from the right). (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 7/20/00.)

603 7/19/00	FIXED	JavaScreen: variable name strings in left window
			are truncated. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 7/20/00.)

604 7/26/00	FIXED	peptide-cgi: view one accession number, then a
			different one, and then go back to the first one:
			the sessions are not updated to the correct data
			source. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 7/26/00.)

605 8/2/00	OPEN	JavaScreen: can't go down into bmrb/dynamic_sessions
			directory (can't follow link?). (rkw)

606 8/3/00	OPEN	JavaScreen: JS can't draw text with orientation
			other than 0 deg. (rkw)

607 8/7/00	WORK	JavaScreen: if you do control-drag, and release
			the control key *after* the mouse button the JS
			never gets the key release event (unless you wait
			until it has finished receiving all commands from
			the devised).
			(Workaround by rkw, 8/7/00.)

608 8/7/00	FIXED	JavaScreen: load Misc/FamMed_pre_post_natal.ds; you
			get NullPointerExceptions every time you move the mouse
			in a view. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 8/7/00.)

609 8/8/00	OPEN	JavaScreen: clicking the Help button doesn't
			display view help in view symbols (F1 in a view
			symbol *does* display the help). (rkw)

610 8/8/00	OPEN	JavaScreen: in JS at BMRB (on aden), in the
			4096_full.ds session, the atoms don't show up in
			the 3D view. (rkw)

611 8/17/00	FIXED	peptide-cgi: for bmr4267.str, the summary file
			contains links to a number of plots for which no
			data is actually generated. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 8/29/00.)

612 8/17/00	FIXED?	peptide-cgi: data files have _stop as the last
			line. (rkw)

613 8/21/00	FIXED	peptide-cgi: code relies on specific names for
			relaxation save frames. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 8/29/00.)

614 8/29/00	OPEN	JavaScreen: looks like it re-parses the mouse format
			strings every time a value is displayed. (rkw)

615 8/30/00	OPEN	If you have both 'all in dest' and a grid set for
			a cursor, the grid code can move a cursor edge
			outside of the destination view. (rkw)

616 8/31/00	FIXED	Start jspop/jss/devised; kill jspop and jss ->
			devised starts to gobble up CPU. (rkw)
			(Fixed by rkw, 9/1/00.)
