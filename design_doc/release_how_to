		How to do a DEVise/JavaScreen Release
		$Id$

This is a quick-and-dirty documentation of what needs to be done for
a DEVise/JavaScreen release (by a release, I mean making a new version
of DEVise accessible to users running from /p/devise in the CS AFS tree,
and putting a new version of the JavaScreen on the "standard" installation
on pumori).

This document should probably be improved eventually -- right now it's
mainly just a reminder to myself so I don't miss any steps.  RKW, 2002-09-24.


- Update sources.
    - Check out/update sources (make sure they're on the right branch,
      if that's necessary).

- Build/test DEVise.
    - Build DEVise on all release architectures (linux/solsparc as of
      2002-09-24).  (Build solsparc on cardinal.)

    - Make strip after building.

    - Test run the monolithic and client-server DEVise (dev, devcs) on all
      relevant architectures.

- Build/test JavaScreen:
    - Build the JavaScreen (including jar files).

    - Run "autotest all" in the JS directory.

- Make sure things are ready to go:
    - Test run the DEVise release script (scripts/release_std) (ANSWER NO
      WHEN ASKED IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DO IT).

    - Test run the JavaScreen release script (scripts/release.js_std) (ANSWER
      NO WHEN ASKED IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DO IT).

- Actual release:
    - Send email warning of the release.

    - After a suitable time, actually run the DEVise and JavaScreen release
      scripts (scripts/release_std and scripts/release.js_std).
    
    - Make sure the released versions actually run on the relevant
      architectures.

    - Send an email with the details of what changed since the last release.

- JavaScreen install on pumori:
    - Go to /p/devise/release/JavaScreen *on pumori*.

    - Make sure Makefile.config points to the appropriate configuration file
      for the setup you want to install.

    - Run the jspop, etc., as test or tst2 and make sure things work.

    - Also log onto pumori as devise, and to go
      /local.pumori.1/devise/js.regular (assuming you want install the
      "regular" setup).  (Go to /local.pumori.1/devise/js.wave for a
      Wavelet-IDR installation or /local.pumori.1/devise/js.soil for
      a soil science installation.)

    - Test run "make -f Makefile.setup install" in
      /p/devise/release/JavaScreen (ANSWER NO WHEN ASKED IF YOU REALLY WANT
      TO DO IT).

    - Send email warning of the release.

    - After a suitable time, do the following:
        - As devise, edit the crontab file so that the check script doesn't
	  run.

	- Also as devise, kill the appropriate JavaScreen processes
	  (kill_jsall).

	- Possibly move the installed JavaScreen directory
	  (/local.pumori.1/devise/js.regular or whatever) to a backup
	  directory (so you can easily back out the installation if
	  necessary).

	- As devise, change the mode in the js.regular directory (or other
	  appropriate directory) to 777.

        - In /p/devise/release/JavaScreen, run "make -f Makefile.setup install"
	  for real.

	- As devise, change the mode of js.regular (or other appropriate
	  directory) back to 755.

	- If doing a Wavelet-IDR install, edit the html files in
	  /var/home/www/public/waveletidr on pumori, and change the cmdport
	  to 6866.

	- If doing a soil science install, edit the html files in
	  /var/home/www/public/soil_sci on pumori, and change the cmdport
	  to 5966.

        - As devise, edit the crontab file so that the check scripts are
	  run again.

        - Wait for the JSPoP to get restarted, and run the JS in a web
	  browser to make sure it works.

        - Send an email with the details of what changed since the last
	  release.

- Tag/archive sources:
    - Cvs tag the source tree (the tag should be of the form
      Mmm_dd_yyyy_release, where Mmm is the three-letter abbreviation for
      the month, dd is the day of the month, and yyyy is the year).

    - Make a tar file of the sources and archive it (run scripts/tarsrcs
      and copy the file to /p/devise/wenger/src_archive).
