		How to Create a DEVise Distribution
		$Id$

This is a quick-and-dirty documentation of what needs to be done for
a DEVise/JavaScreen/peptide-cgi distribution (by a distribution, I mean
making tar files that can be downloaded and installed by users who have
no access to the CS AFS tree).

This document should probably be improved eventually -- right now it's
mainly just a reminder to myself so I don't miss any steps.  RKW, 2002-09-30.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  the DEVise and JavaScreen files that are put into the
distribution come from /p/devise/release, not the area in which you're
running the distribution scripts.  However, the peptide-cgi files come
from the peptide_cgi tree in which you run the distribution scripts.

- Generate DEVise/JavaScreen distribution:
    - Go to the dist directory.

    - Run "make setup".

    - Run "make dist".

    - Do a test installation from each tar file to make sure it works.

- Generate peptide-cgi distribution:
    - Be sure the version in the peptide_cgi tree works correctly.

    - Go to peptide_cgi.

    - Run "make setup".

    - Run "make dist".

    - Copy the distribution tar file into the appropriate subdirectory
      in /p/devise/ftp.

    - Do a test installation from the tar file to make sure it works.

- BMRB mirror site instructions:
    - Copy bmrb_mirror_instructions into the appropriate subdirectory
      in /p/devise/ftp.

- Tag/archive sources:
    - Cvs tag the source tree (the tag should be of the form dist_x_y_z,
      where the DEVise version is x.y.z.

    - There should already be a DEVise/JavaScreen source archive (see
      the release document).

    - Archive the peptide-cgi sources by checking out a version with
      the appropriate tag, tarring it up, and copying the file to
      /p/devise/wenger/src_archive.
