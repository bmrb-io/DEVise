		To-do 08.003: Eliminate all dependencies on having
			/p/devise for a DEVise installation
				2015-10-06

I'm thinking that we should probably have a release_dir and and ftp_dir
or something in the source tree, and have releases (at least optionally)
go to the local release_dir instead of /p/devise/release, and when you
generate a distribution tarball, have the binaries come from the local
release_dir and go into the local ftp_dir.  That way you could make release
tarballs without changing /p/devise/release, and then install from the
tarball into /p/devise/release.  And you'd manually copy the tarballs
into the "real" ftp directory when they're ready to be made public.
