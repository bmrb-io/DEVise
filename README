*** Checkout and Setup

You should have gotten this file by doing a 'cvs checkout world', or some
variation on that, with your CVSROOT environment variable set to
/p/devise/cvs.

Immediately after doing the checkout, run the command 'setup' in the
same directory in which you did the checkout.  Setup makes some symbolic
links in the source tree that you will need for compiling on most
architectures.


*** Compiling

To compile DEVise, cd to the directory appropriate for your system
architecture (hp, solaris, solsparc, etc.).  Most of the system architecture
directory names should be pretty self-explanatory.  Note that 'solaris'
is for Intel/Solaris, and 'solsparc' is for SPARC/Solaris.

To build the "normal" (monolithic) version of DEVise, make the target
'generic' in the appropriate architecture directory.  This will end up
making an executable called 'generic' in the 'generic' subdirectory.
Other targets include 'all', 'devise', 'multi', 'static' (for some
architectures), 'pure' (for some architectures), and 'cslib'.

You may need to update the dependency files to get the sources to compile
correctly.  To do this, go to the top level source directory (where you
did the 'cvs checkout') and enter the command:

	makedep <arch>

where <arch> is replaced by the Makefile suffix for your architecture
(hp, sun, etc.).  Don't commit the updated makefiles to the source
repository unless you're sure you want to do that.  If you don't commit
them, you can still use them to compile your copy of the sources.

To compile DEVise with debugging on, just set the environment variable
DEV_DEBUG to a non-zero value.  You don't have to change any of the
makefiles.


*** Executables

Most executables are produced in the generic subdirectory under the
appropriate architecture directory (solaris/generic/generic, for
example).  One exception to this is the 'multi' executable, which is
<arch>/multi/disp.

When you are developing DEVise, you will probably want to make a customized
version or versions of the devise startup script that run your DEVise
executable with your DEVise Tcl/Tk code.  You can produce such a script
by modifying the default startup script (/p/devise/run/devise).  Here is
an example:

    #! /bin/csh -f
    # Run my DEVise executable and Tcl/Tk code with global sessions, schemas,
    # and data.

    # Allow core dumps for developers...
    #limit coredumpsize 0
    limit descriptors 256

    setenv DEVISE_ROOT    /p/devise

    setenv DEVISE_DAT     $DEVISE_ROOT/dat
    setenv DEVISE_CACHE   $DEVISE_ROOT/cache
    setenv DEVISE_SCHEMA  $DEVISE_ROOT/schema/schema
    setenv DEVISE_SESSION $DEVISE_ROOT/session
    setenv DEVISE_LIB     ../lib
    setenv DEVISE_TMP     /tmp/`whoami`-devise-tmp
    setenv DEVISE_WORK    /tmp/`whoami`-devise-work
    setenv DEVISE_EXEC    generic/generic

    if (! -f $DEVISE_EXEC) then
      echo "Cannot find Devise executable. Perhaps this platform is not supported?"
      exit 1
    endif

    $DEVISE_EXEC -sharedMem 0 $*


*** Releasing Software

Most DEVise developers should not do releases, at least not to
/p/devise/public.

(This section is not yet complete.)
(release, release.linux, release.devcs, release.cslib)


*** Generating Distributions

Most DEVise developers should not generate distribution files.

(This section is not yet complete.)
(gen_dist)


*** Mailing List

All developers should be on the deviseproj mailing list.  You can subscribe
to this mailing list by sending mail to deviseproj-request@cs.wisc.edu with
the following as the message body:

    subscribe

When you commit changes to the code, please send a short description of
them to the deviseproj mailing list.  This makes it easier to know when
to release new versions of the code, and so on.
