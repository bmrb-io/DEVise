	Instructions for DEVise/JavaScreen/Peptide-CGI Installation
	$Id$

* INTRODUCTION

This file contains instructions for installing the DEVise-related software
at BMRB mirror sites.

Note:  the DEVise/JavaScreen software is designed to be untarred into a
directory that you use for configuration and testing, and then installed
into other directories for the "production" system once the configuration
is correct.  This way, when you need to install a new version, you can
untar the new version in a new directory, copy over the configuration
settings from your previous version, test that everything is okay, and
then install over the top of the existing "production" version.  This
allows upgrades with the minimum change of taking down the "production"
system.


* OVERALL INSTALLATION

You can install DEVise separately from the rest of the BMRB mirror site;
however, some of the DEVise-related configuration depends on where you
will be installing the BMRB mirror files.  Whether you install DEVise
before or after the rest of the mirror site, it's best to test the
DEVise-related software by itself, and then in combination with the
NMR Browser.

There are four main parts to the DEVise-related mirror installation:
- Demo area skeleton
- DEVise itself
- JavaScreen
- Peptide-cgi

The parts should be installed in that order.


* FILES

To get the distribution files, go to:

    ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/pub/devise

Then go to the directory containing the most recent DEVise distribution.
The directory is of the form Devise-x.x.x, where x.x.x is the DEVise version.
(At the time of writing, the most recent version is 1.7.18.)

You should get the following files:
- Devise-x.x.x-demo.tar.gz
- Devise-x.x.x-JavaScreen.tar.gz
- Devise-x.x.x-linux-intel*.tar.gz or Devise-x.x.x-solaris-sparc.tar.gz,
  depending on your machine architecture
- peptide-cgi_x.x.tgz (where x.x is the peptide-cgi version)


* USERS

You should have to do very little, if any, of the installation process
as root.  It's probably best if you create a "normal" user to do all
of the installation, and if you run into places that need root permission,
simply manually create the required directories as root (you may want to
do a chown on them, to the user doing the installation).

The JavaScreen processes do *not* have to run as root, and in fact
should not, for security.  Basically, the DEVised processes run to
support the JavaScreen need read permissions in the demo area,
and write permission in the .tmp directory within the demo area
session directory.

The web server user needs write permission in the peptide-cgi
dynamic_data and dynamic_sessions directories.


* DEMO AREA INSTALLATION

To install the demo area skeleton, simply untar the Devise-x.x.x-demo.tar.gz
file in an appropriate directory.


* DEVISE INSTALLATION

First, untar the appropriate Devise-x.x.x-<platform>.tar.gz file.

If you're not sure which Devise file is appropriate for your platform,
please contact the DEVise Development group (devise-sup@cs.wisc.edu).

To make sure that DEVise itself runs properly, go to the run directory,
and run the script devise.  When DEVise starts up, select Open from
the Session menu, and then select one of the DEVise session (*.ds) files.
When you open the session file, one or more windows with graphs should
be displayed.  You should also run the script devise.ldemo to make sure
that the demo area skeleton works correctly.

If DEVise core dumps on startup, especially on Linux, try getting
rid of the dyn_lib directory.  Sometimes having it helps, sometimes
it doesn't.

Note: in the current form of the distribution, DEVise itself is not
configured to be installed other that as part of the JavaScreen installation.
This limitation should be removed in the near future.


* XVFB INSTALLATION

Note that for the JavaScreen to work, you must have Xvfb (X virtual frame
buffer) installed on the machine on which the JSS and DEViseds will run.
You can find sources, and executables for various architectures, on the
web.  It doesn't matter where you install Xvfb, since you will edit
the config file to indicate the path to the executable.  You should
try running the following command to make sure that Xvfb works on your
system:

    Xvfb :1 -screen 0 1280x1024x8

On some systems (especially some Linux systems) you may have to add
the arguments '-fp "unix/:-1"' to enable Xvfb to find the fonts it
needs.


* JAVASCREEN INSTALLATION

First, untar the Devise-x.x.x-JavaScreen.tar.gz file.  You MUST untar
this file in the same directory where you untarred the DEVise
distribution file (because the JavaScreen distribution relies on
relative links to some of the DEVise files).

Change to the JavaScreen directory, then copy the appropriate
Makefile.config.* file to Makefile.config, and edit Makefile.config
appropriately.  CONFIG.txt has detailed explanations of all of the
configuration parameters.  Note that you will have to change the
INSTALL_HOST variable.

Make sure that your Makefile.config defines ERROR_EMAIL (for example,
'ERROR_EMAIL = zoo@bmrb.wisc.edu').  (This is the user who will get email
warnings in the case of JSPoP errors being detected.)

Once you've finished editing Makefile.config, run the command
'make -f Makefile.setup clean setup'.

You can test the JavaScreen as follows:
- Run the command 'restart_jspop test 1'.  (Note that running the JSPoP
  with the ID 'test' avoids conflict with any production JSPoP running
  as 'regular' on the same machine.)
- This should start the following processes:
    - java jspop
    - java jss
    - Xvfb
    - devised
- Then run 'js -cmdport6266' (you need to specify a cmdport of 6266 to
  connect with a JSPoP running as test.  You should be able to open a
  session file in the JavaScreen.
- Run 'kill_jsall' to kill off the JavaScreen processes before doing the
  actual install.

To do the actual installation, perform the following steps:

- If you are installing a new version of the JavaScreen in place of an
  older version, if possible do the installation when no user is actually
  connected to the JSPoP.  You can find out what users are connected by
  looking at the jspop.out.regular log file in the logs directory of the
  previously-installed version.

- If you are installing a new version of the JavaScreen in place of an
  older version, it's a good idea to send an email to any known users
  that the JavaScreen will be unavailable for a short period of time.

- If you are installing a new version of the JavaScreen in place of an
  older version, you MUST kill all of the processes of the old version
  before doing the installation.  Do this by going to the directory where
  the old version is installed, and running the command

    kill_jsall

  Make sure you've killed everything off -- run 'ps' and make sure there are
  no jspop, jss, or devised processes running.

- Run the command:

    make -f Makefile.setup install

  This will do the actual installation into your selected directory.

- Edit your crontab file to create a cron job that automatically checks
  the JSPop.  Look at the supplied cron_entry.* files, especially
  cron_entry.tuna, for examples.  The cron job should cd to the directory
  where the JavaScreen is installed, and then run "./run_check regular 4".
  
  After installing the cron job, you should get an email stating that no
  jspop process was found; after that, the JavaScreen-related processes
  should be running (see the list of processes above).

  Note that you may need to edit the paths in run_check according to the
  details of your installation.

- Edit your crontab file to create a cron job that generates JavaScreen
  usage statistics once a week, by cding to the directory where the
  JavaScreen is installed and running scripts/get_stats_bmrb.  Look at
  cron_entry.tuna for an example.

- Once you've installed the JavaScreen, make sure that the servers have
  restarted correctly.  You MUST have a jspop process, a jss process, and
  at least one devised process.

  You should also run the 'check_connect' command.  If all of the necessary
  processes are running, this will output 'OK'.  Any other output means
  that soemthing is not working correctly.

  The final check is to actually run the JavaScreen applet on your web
  site.  You can do this via the NMR Data Browser or the jsa.html web
  page.


* PEPTIDE-CGI INSTALLATION

Untar the peptide-cgi_x.x.tgz in an appropriate directory.  Then see the
INSTALL file in the peptide-cgi directory for configuration and
installation instructions.


* CONCLUSION

After all of this has been done, you should be able to access DEVise/JavaScreen
visualizations via the NMR Browser.
